I feel like I have graduated a bit. I am not focusing on improvements to Frontseat anymore and have started to start digging into this next idea of helping brands in the metaverse. 

Still don't know what the product looks like. We are reaching out to some people I know at Roblox focused on brand partnerships for some vibes/feedback.

In the meantime, I am dusting off Roblox Studio skills and doing some tutorials. Best guess at the MVP involves something that gets brands insights into their virtual experiences and audiences. 

I'd like to have a test game to see what existing analytics solutions like Playfab, Google analytics and others look like. 

My hypothesis is that brands are not getting the insight that they are looking for post-investing in building a persistent virtual experience. I know that tools exist to help develop event-driven insights outside of Roblox. And the analytics Roblox provides are not particularly deep (engagement, etc).

But--it is just a guess, and part of validating that is actually digging into the technology and putting myself in the brand and their contracted developers' shoes. 

It's a 7 part tutorial and I kicked it off tonight. The drop off is 1.3M views --> 66K views in the last video (5%).

Writing at a regular pace has been difficult when faced with the difficult decision to pump the breaks on Frontseat. But it shouldn't. Writing through the difficult pivoting decisions I have been rolling around with would have probably helped me arrive at this conclusion faster.

C'est la vie
