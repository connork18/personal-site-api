I'm on part 4 of 8 of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZDkHZMtTO4&list=RDCMUCp1R0TBvgM7gj0rwTYULmSA&start_radio=1&rv=VZDkHZMtTO4&t=1459">Piggy</a> Roblox game tutorial and it is soooo awesome.

My brain hurts, but I think it is because I can only do this late at night when I am tired since I am watching my daughter all day.

I am absolutely loving this, but I am not a big gamer myself. I also love <i>playing</i> sports, but am not a big watcher of sports. Maybe there is some crossover there, idk.

I am enjoying understanding the different components of building a game and building digital experiences in 3D spaces. I am a math person, so thinking about physics in the context of building and managing experiences is fun. 

I am also peeling back some of the mechanics of how Roblox (and other online multiplayer games work). The challenges of keeping all clients apprised of latest status and also the divison of labor to calculate the physics of a given object is pretty cool. Feels like there is so much complex stuff going on.

Only scratching the surface's surface but I always enjoy so much the moment of starting to understand something that was previously a total and complete mystery to me.
