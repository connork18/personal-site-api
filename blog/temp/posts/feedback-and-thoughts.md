Another feedback session from someone that would classify more as an explorer. 

Notes:
 * FIX THE BUGS!!! I can't keep explaining these hacks to people or apologize for the bugs.
 * The feeds layout was confusing. "If I click on "FEEDS" on the bottom tab, why wouldn't it take me to my list of feeds?" 
 * People don't know what the hamburger button does or even really think to click on it.
 * Filtering by genre is kind of confusing. She wanted to be able to search for the more nuanced genres.
 * Leading with auto-export to playlist is kind of confusing, it requires reading before people even know what it means.
 * Didn't see the auto-export button, but likes that it loads the whole feed into Spotify.

Thoughts on the last few feedback sessions:
 * it is unclear whether my filter UI is just un-finished, or sub-optimal
 * bugs suck, must fix
 * need to be able to find people
 * the floating action button gets glossed over
 * I need more feedback to draw out real trends
 * people don't know that thecurrent and bffdotfm are radio stations
 * the filter screen feels like a weird place for the auto export option to be
 * the genre filter feature is half-baked and you can tell
 * the radio stations filter should be the lowest priority

Thoughts on plan of action:
 * list out all of the things that get in the way of this being a standalone app that a stranger can download and have a chance at a successful experience
 * prioritize them and fix them, while trying to avoid reacting to the feedback with any big, sweeping changes
 * keep getting feedback along the way, ideally from brand new people
