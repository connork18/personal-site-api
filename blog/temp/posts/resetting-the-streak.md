I missed yesterday's post, which ends my streak at 17 days. 

I am going to try to make up for it by writing two today. I may start adding my streak to the front page of my website as added motivation to get to 365 days in a row.

I posted for 17 days in a row though! I am doing this to instill a consistent practice of creating content and to provide a space that allows me to think through the many issues I am facing while building solo. 

I am not have hit my goal yet, but I am moving in the right direction.
