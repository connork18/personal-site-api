Woke up at 5:15am this morning to do some education stuff--what am I more motivated to do?

Consume 2.5 hours of lectures in cryptography, or finish the Bitcoin and ethereum whitepapers? or do some more Ethereum development tutorials?

My programmed self feels compelled to do my cryptography course. I would like to have all of the information in that course in my head. And then my next programmed self is motivated to finish the whitepapers.

But my highest actual motivation is to just start building and revisit all of those things as I get frustrated encountering things that I don't understand. 

Looks like I have my answer.
