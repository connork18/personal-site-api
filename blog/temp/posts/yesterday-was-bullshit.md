I saw a post by Gary Vaynerchuck that said something like: "Selling is not hard. It is only hard when you don't believe in what you are selling." 

As I have reflected about my lengthy blog post yesterday, I realized that I am not motivated to work on the first time user experience (at all). I am motivated to add more bells and whistles that make myself happier and the app more useful to me. 

Why would I "sell" this app by making the onboarding experience better before I am even happy using it myself? I have all of my major music influencers on the app and a gold mine of data at my disposal. If I am not enjoying it yet, nobody will.

So, contrary to what I said yesterday, I am going to work on adding the functionality that makes it more valuable to me and to one other target user I talked with last night. 

I will work on selling when I am ready.
