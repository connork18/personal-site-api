yikes- I was working through issues with Frontseat all day and it was such a mystery.

I learned and relearned a ton of nitty gritty details about how things work like JWT, load balancers, SSL certificates, names servers, the internet, blah blah blah.

If my investigation was correct and my solution holds, it is possible that I saved myself $60 per month in database costs.

My goal is to get my product stable enough and my website filled out enough to test some marketing, see if I can get feedback on my idea and approach and maybe some users that will be willing to provide me feedback in the future as well.

Maybe I will do some google advertising on my own before I sign up to use ad spot with The Vogue. Feels like the first time I do this, I am going to be underwhelmed by the results and realize I am doing things wrong.
