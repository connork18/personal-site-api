I turn 30 tomorrow, god-willing.

I also:

 * might have found a co-founder

 * might be putting Frontseat on autopilot while I pivot to something with stronger business potential

 * might be focusing on metaverse marketing and leveraging my Roblox background

 * regardless of what I do, I will DEFINITELY be following a strict, lean approach to my next venture. test, validate, pivot, repeat, repeat, repeat, then build.
