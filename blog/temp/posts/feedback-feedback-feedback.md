I got lots of good feedback from users that are getting value out of the app through the playlists.

The feedback is not straightforward and doesn't 100% support the design I had in my head. 

One of the issues in particular is my thought that the optimal app structure is to limit playlists to having one user.

The entire app is about connecting people, and most users only follow a few people at the moment. 

But forcing this constraint would lose some of the flexibility that people seem to enjoy. 2 of 4 people that listen to the playlists pretty frequently have multiple sources included in their playlists.

So what are the facts?
 * the people I got feedback from like the playlist generation piece of the app
 * the people I got feedback from use the app in the way that I imagined--a periodic check-in to tweak their playlist filters
 * none of the people seemed to jump at the idea of letting me filter out the bad songs for them
 * there are other people who like the app premise, but don't listen to any playlists at all (and I know have struggled with playlist quality)
 * there are people that log in to the app to snipe songs from the feed as opposed to listening to whole playlists
 * there are people who would like to use the app to connect more with people over shared music

It feels like there might be 3-4 different aims that my users currently pursue:
 1) help me get music recommendations from my friends that I like.
 2) give me new music that I like in playlists. period.
 3) help me connect with people over shared music.
 4) entertain me by showing me what people are listening to, letting me discover the occasional new song.

Appeasing all sounds like something close to my current app structure. Is it in the best interest of Frontseat to pick only one?

Instead of picking one, can I focus on iteratively improving each of these jobs to be done and make them more efficient?

I may encounter crossroads where increasing the service of one job may come at the expense of servicing another, and that is okay. 

I think it is ok for a product to serve more than one job--that is what makes platforms so interesting. It just provides a scope challenge if you try to do all 4 and do a mediocre job.

I also think it is ok to lean into the playlists/friends "aims"/jobs without redesigning the whole app. I can test it iteratively.

ITS ONE BIG PUZZLE
