Feeling all kinds of weird feels at the moment. 

Let's list them one at a time:

 * The DJ that I was incredibly pumped to speak with was a no show for our zoom meeting. She was so kind and works a ton. I have to assume she has her reasons. Hopefully I can figure out a way to speak with her.
 
 * I submitted my startup application. This is a great milestone and now gives me the chance to circle back with some of the mentors that aren't aware of my pivot. 

 * I defined my next experiments but am realizing how hard they are going to be. This is the first time I have done significant re-work to how my application works. It would almost be easier to start fresh, but I have users now--some of which I want to continue getting feedback from. It requires backend changes and frontend changes, so I need to be careful when changing one or the other.

 * I need to break it up into small parts/batches/experiments. I think this will make it seem less overwhelming. And I have to remember, "THIS WHOLE APPROACH COULD BE WRONG!!" Therefore, creating the best version of the new, simpler app in my head is not the most efficient way to pleasing customers. 

 * My workouts and health has been subpar. I really want to 1) move my journal to the backend I created and 2) start posting my workouts on here. I injured my neck out of nowhere and, in classic Connor fashion, have let that injury disrupt my whole workout vibe, rather than continuing to keep my body moving without it.

 * I would be lying if I said that I don't look at jobs periodically. (I seriously debated including this, but there it is!)

 * Crypto periodically calls my name. Or more specifically, crypto twitter. Crypto and web3 technologies seem very aligned with some of the core principles that underpin Frontseat and my entrepeneurial direction. My biggest issue right now is that I am as good as the customer base I have insight into, and most of the customers I am interested in serving right now do not have crypto wallets. 
 
 * I deleted my instagram profile recently and have debated deleting twitter. The number of new ideas that fly around twitter are pretty incredible, as are the ideas that summarize things that have been floating around in my head. It has been a huge help to discover a class of people that are indie hacking and that have similar views on health, wealth and happiness. But I really think that in social media products you are either marketing or you are being marketed to. Independent thinking is an enormous competitive advantage, and I think that twitter can reduce my independent thinking. I start adopting other people's ideas, rather than remaining inquisitive and getting to an opinion myself. BUT I have made such cool discoveries that reflect the depth of the market I am trying to serve, including independent music curators hosting live streams on Twitch where they are spinning records and interacting with their fans.

Time to finally get an early morning workout in, and then it is back to some hardcore product development today.
