* I will be teaching a course called "Guided Entrepreneurship" next semester at my high school for 4 students and getting paid by the Batesville Community Education Foundation to do so. 

* This is going to be really hard. I will be onboarding onto the widely used Canvas Learning Management System, which could be an opportunity to build some tech that helps me/other teachers as I am teaching the course. 

* I have a lot of explicit and implicit feedback from my most recent Frontseat experiment to digest and decide on my next steps. 

* Only 1 of my 6 signups has come back more than one week since she left, and it is a DJ that I have worked really hard to build a relationship with. 

* I sent that DJ some stats on her show when reaching out to her, which she liked and asked if she could share on social media. I then did some more work and turned it into a cool branded graphic. She also is the only new user that has found and used the more engaging and powerful features like filtering, etc. This kind of makes sense because DJs have a business problem to solve--they need to discover music as part of their job (whether it is a paid job or a volunteer position)

* This makes me think about pivoting to serving these DJs and their communities--including the local venues. 

* I feel like I have overinvested, and overinvesting is demoralizing. I have invested significantly in a technology and have been pursuing fragments of communities to see if I can use the technology to add value to them. This is clearly not the way.

* Adding value to a community you care about using the minimal investment necessary and eventually understanding them deeply enough to identify a problem they all have that you can provide a scalable solution to feels like something closer to the way.
