title: 'The first email I sent to a business re: Frontseat'

I reached out to a business for the very first time about Frontseat. THe business is a sandwich shop that had cool art and tons of books and they were playing awesome music: [Porter Books & Bread](https://www.yelp.com/biz/porter-books-and-bread-indianapolis-2). We just stumbled upon it on the way to see my dad. I think that Frontseat could be an awesome way for businesses like this (such as wineries, record stores, bars, etc) to add more value to their customers and help benefit their core business via increased retention. 

I am fully prepared for silence, "no", and lots of follow up, but I am happy to have crossed it as a milestone. Here is the email I sent:

-----------------------

Subject: Follow up on the music discovery project I mentioned

Hi ------,

My name is Connor. As a refresher, you gave me your email on Sunday at Porter Books & Bread.

Below is more detail on the music discovery project I am working on and why <strong>I would love for you to download my app and create a free account:</strong>

It is called <strong>Frontseat:</strong> a mobile app with (early) versions available in the [Google Play]('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frontseat') and [Apple App]('https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frontseat-music/id1541167797') stores. It is a self-funded project and I am doing everything myself.

The app helps people efficiently discover music from sources they trust (friends, businesses, radio stations). It does this by letting people share their listening activity with one another, create filters and generate playlists on a regular basis.

It also helps businesses like yours engage with your customers. You can add more value to them with content you are already creating and stay at the top of their mind as a result. For example - - I would have loved to follow Porter Books & Bread on the app after digging the vibe, the art in the restaurant and the music you were playing inspired by the Pixies documentary you watched.

You are the first business I have spoken to about this, and I would love for you to create an account. It is free, you just need to know your Spotify account credentials so that you can authenticate with the Spotify account you use in the restaurant.

If you create an account at this early stage in the project, I will make sure you are updated on the progress I am making. Whenever you would feel comfortable introducing it to your community, I would do everything I could to make sure it was successful.

Your feedback at this stage both as a business user and as a music fan yourself would be invaluable to me to ensure I build features that are useful and help your business. 

Please let me know if you have any questions, would like to chat on the phone or could use help signing up successfully. Thank you very much for reading.

Best,
Connor
