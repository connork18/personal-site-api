I broke my journal entry streak (bummer) but crushed my prior streak (24 vs. 7). Push the reset button!

I had a feedback session this evening. Here is what I learned:
 * generating playlists is cool and a desired feature
 * my implementation of playlist generation is not intuitive
 * there are some bugs in my people data management system
 * discovering music is like eating healthy--something that is good, but it requires time and effort and sacrifice
 * the hide button is a useful and intuitive feature
 * my custom made add-to-queue icon successfully mimicks spotify's. tbd on its usefulness.
 * it is not super clear what the spotify button does. It is essentially a play button.
 * the new filters UI appears successful and intuitive. 
 * it is difficult to find the right people to follow.
 * the lack of real-time interactions in requesting/accepting friends is kind of a killer.
 * there are several "hacks" that users need my guidance on in order to get to a successful experience.

Cool. I have another feedback session tomorrow. Hopefully there is some overlap in the problems/takeaways!
