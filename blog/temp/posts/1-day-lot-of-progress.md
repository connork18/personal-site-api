Awesome progress on the priorities I had for this next phase. If only the app store gods would just review my app already.

Potentially the most important thing I have done is adding the Find Friends function in the log in flow.

Currently, I am working on push notifications. I realized that I am going to need to think through the user<>push-token data structure a little bit more.

Once I have push notifications and real-time updating friend requests/acceptance notifications AND find friends feature in the onboarding flow, I will kind of have a real app!

I have gotten positive feedback on the idea of a slack channel dedicated to providing feedback. That is also something I am going to try to do before the end of the week. I will make as many improvements as I can before I call that out.

The notifications thing will definitely be a multi-day effort and I will be lucky to get it out and thoroughly tested before the end of the week.

I am also excited to add 30s samples and potentially provide a quick sample/next feature that auto-scrolls as people are using it. That would other be another 1 week+ effort, but feels like a pretty high likelihood of increasing the usefulness and user happiness if I can pull it off smoothly on both platforms.

Fun stuff!
