Rule #1: Don't get mad

Rule #2: Don't get mad

I got this advice in college by one of my teammates to primarily be applied in social situations / bullying type stuff. 

I believe it is excellent advice that can be applied towards most situations. Said another way (per <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1162111683034116096?lang=en">Naval</a>): "Choose the non-emotional response to any given situation and see how much easier your life becomes."
