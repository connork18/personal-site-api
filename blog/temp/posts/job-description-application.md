<b>Job Description:</b>

I want more good music I like in exchange for minimal incremental effort.

My Discover Weekly is okay, but I feel dissatisfied. I know lots of people that have awesome tastes in certain genre and I would love to get a never ending stream of recommendations from them!

I am looking for a service to help me fill this void. 

Service must:
 * Give me fresh new music that I like from sources I trust
 * Make the music available to me when I want it, where I want it
 * Make it available for me to listen to at a moment's notice
 * Help me connect more often with people I care about around shared interest in music
 * Help remind and motivate me to discover more new music more often
 * Provide music in useful quantities so that it can fill large gaps of time without requiring constant management

Service must NOT:
 * Require lots of incremental upfront and especially ongoing time investment

<b>Job Application</b>

Hello,

My name is Frontseat--I am a mobile app and playlist generator service. I exist to help you create playlists of music that you like based on people you like.

Follow diverse sources like friends, radio stations or album review companies like Pitchfork, specify the types of genres you are looking for (and those you are not) and create playlists that update on a weekly basis. 

In addition to our playlists, connect with friends over what you are listening to, track your music discovery journey through listening stats and get notifications about concerts that you and your friends may be interested in.

We work hard to give you as many awesome recommendations as possible from the people you trust AND have opportunities to connect over that shared music. We know you are busy and that your time is valuable. We also know that you want to discover more music. We help you save time exploring AND discover more music.

Discover Weekly have you stuck in a loop? Follow your friends on Frontseat.

Playlists for you based on the people you trust.
