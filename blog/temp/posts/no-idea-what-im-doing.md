I have no idea what the right thing to do next is. Lol

My instinct tells me that I need to appeal more to creators. My "parasitic" product model right now where the suppliers of music get zero value from the platform is not sustainable. 

I could optimize the playlist creation flow to make my existing users have a better experience. This could make them a little happier, which could make them compelled to invite a friend to the platform so they can see their music. 

But -- based on prior experience, that person would probably go through the effort of signing up and then churn (or possibly not even make to the point of accepting the follow request that is the reason they came to the platform).

The alternative is to start strengthening my value proposition to those people. My belief is that in order for this product to survive in its current form, I need to do this eventually anyway. 

My hesitancy is that it seems like an expensive endeavor and my existing happy users aren't directly asking for it.

But they are asking for more sources. 

Should I brute force more sources? Or try to create value for explorers?

My other hypothesis is that everyone has a little explorer in them, and even the people who like the playlists may also benefit from the features that create value for the explorers.

Not sure. But what I do know is that thinking and strategizing is not terribly productive and just getting started is usually a good way to let the natural path emerge.
