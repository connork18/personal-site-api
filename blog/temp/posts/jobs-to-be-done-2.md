I have been re-reading <i>Competing Against Luck</i> by Clayton Christensen.

I am excited that that framework reinforces my suspicions about re-investing in the things that I have found people like the most about my app (as opposed to chasing new things that I see working in other apps).

I am nervous/anxious because it may mean redesigning my app.

My excitement/optimism definitely outweighs any negatives. I am excited to dig in, talk to my existing users, hear their feedback on my direction and try to put together something people find valuable.
