Customer acquisition in web3 is very interesting. 

When putting together a 30-60-90 day plan for a web3 community management tool startup I was hoping to start, my day 1 go-to-market strategy was to build a list of the top tokenized projects, join their discords and figure out who is running the community, and figure out how to DM them. 

I was surprised at how difficult and time consuming this was. OpenSea has APIs to fetch lots of NFT projects but you can't sort them. They have an interface that allows you to access this information, but it is non-scrapeable or even copy-pastable. They take more measures than I have seen any other company take to prevent web-scraping. It's really interesting that their APIs don't allow sorting--even Roblox APIs allow that and their scale is much, much bigger.

The other pillars of the strategy would be targeting partnerships with agencies, community management groups and individual influencers. This again would require a pretty labor intensive, relationship building process. 

I'm currently building an NFT project of my own. I am not planning to do a lot of things that typically make NFT projects successful like building a community and selling before delivering the art. I am making clear that there is no roadmap, but I am leaving the possibilities open for there to be things built on top of it in the future (by me or someone else). And I have partnered with artist friends to create something we like.

But it is helping me think through what the customer / community acquisition strategy would look like. I intentionally ignore every Twitter Ad I see for an NFT project and every Discord DM I get about a new project. Any traffic that is purchased in web3 is sort of assumed to be a scam. 

As a new NFT project, if I were <i>really</i> wanting to build something successful, I would build my landing page, twitter profile, OpenSea profile, mirror.xyz presence and Discord first to communicate the story, benefits, roadmap and aesthetic. I would start publishing content that resonates with my audience. I would ensure that I am targeting something interesting and relatively unique--if someone is searching a relevant keyword on OpenSea, I would want my project to show up even if there aren't any sales. I would do this months before considering dropping the NFT -- as soon as I had the idea. 

While I am setting these up, I would be immersing myself in the communities of other projects that could be great partnerships. I would probably be buying NFTs in these communities. The more I can legitimize my relationships with these communities, the better chance I will have at pursuing opportunities to advertise my project. 

Usually, projects that have garnered audiences worth pursuing for my own project are in a phase where they trying to get engaged community members to start contributing to their vision. If there is a small bounty or some way I can contribute to the communities that I'd like to partner with, that would be great. 

If I take a quick pause to review this off-the-cuff strategy, my user acquisition budget is transitioning from buying virtual billboard space to buying complementary NFTs and funding contributions to other projects.

I feel like there might be a newer opportunity for individual influencers as well. You can always tell whether someone is a trusted member of a Discord server. They have a bunch of roles and have leveled up. When you click on the usernames of these people, there is rarely anything written in their profile space. This could be prime real estate for them to show which projects they are on the whitelist for. The problem would be reaching these individual influencers. Maybe that would be an opportunity for a 3rd party web3 influencer platform, where early projects basically pitch to blue-chip web3 users.  

These people are already sniffing out new projects. And as an early adopter of a project, you have immediate financial incentives to advertise that position, as long as you trust the people involved will not "rug" the project.

I think there are probably other opportunities to acquire customers. I didn't mention airdropping tokens or adding addresses to a whitelist. I suppose if I could find out the wallet addresses of people I think could be key influencers and marketeres of my project, I could add them to a whitelist and even mint a free NFT for them? 

In general, my observation has been that in web3, influencers and personal relationships are more important than ever to acquire customers.

Finally--the easiest way for brands to get exposure to web3 is through partnering with existing projects. Lots of golf brands are partnering with LinksDAO to provide discounts to their members. It is less expensive than publishing your own NFT project. It is also a mutually beneficial proposition, especially if the partnership involves the brand providing perks to the NFT holders.

As a brand, I want to find the projects that have the biggest audience, with lots of engagement and a mission, aesthetic or other dimension that overlaps significantly with my brand. This data is not readily available on OpenSea (or some of the other on-chain analytics services) because it involves their Discord data, the art and reputations and backgrounds of the individuals behind the projects.

I guess a little bit of what I am envisioning is a platform where successful web3 projects or web3 influencers connected with brands and new NFT projects. Brands and new NFT projects are the demand side, existing projects are the supply side. 

It is an interesting problem space that I am sure people are figuring out. And I'm sure I am probably missing some core strategies people are deploying. But I wonder if there are any opportunities to turn a valuable workstream that is so difficult or time-consuming that it is virtually impossible and making it possible.
