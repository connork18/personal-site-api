Physical health development comes before software development in my priority stack.

I have made significant progress towards my goals, but that is only because I absolutely crushed workouts on Sunday/Monday. Great workouts => endorphins, energy and discipline. 

Today, I did a lot of coding, but missed a workout and didn't have much outside time.

Need to bounce back tomorrow -- if I don't get some of these features in this week, big whoop. 

Whatever I create while blasting in hermit frantic coder mode will probably be lower quality than what I could create in disciplined, focused and sustainable coder mode.
