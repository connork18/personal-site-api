title: 'Topics on my mind'

It has been a week or so since posting, so I am cheating with a data dump of topics--not even formulated thoughts--that are on my mind:

 * High Alpha is the real deal 
 * Participated in one of their sprint weeks for a business I am passionate about
 * Ideal world -- I'd like to start building that business ASAP
 * Looking forward to getting a great workout in tomorrow
 * Thinking in public is weirder when you are more dependent on others and not making a living as a indie hacker
 * web3 is fun and is where I'll be living for the foreseeable future
 * building an NFT project with my designer friends
 * advising a web3 gaming NFT marketplace -- need to decide what I can commit to, I want to help
 * had a blast with my daughter this afternoon
 * grateful that I have a warm house, an incredible wife and family and a bed to sleep in tonight
 * need to get back to a regular sleep schedule
 * want to knock out the api for this, feel like it is a little overkill maybe?
 * build a discord bot that exports server activity to google sheet
