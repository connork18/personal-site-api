title: 'Now I actually want to work on the new user experience'

So I now have an app that I enjoy and that is providing me value. After my interaction with the business that I emailed yesterday and talking to some other users on the app, I feel motivated to improve the first time user experience. 

I had continued to grapple with the decision to prioritize (1) adding more core (bigger investment) features like enabling people to react to songs and message each other and including profiles with listening stats to try to maximize the value that my small existing user base is getting (2) making my existing feature set better and more accessible within the app, or (3) improving the first time user experience.

I feel pretty motivated to pursue (3) and then (2) so that I can provide a good of an experience as possible to new (and existing) users. If I don't make my existing feature set accessible to them, I may not get real feedback.

Ultimately, I think the best version of this product includes the bigger investment features in (1). But I have some powerful stuff in there that is not available anywhere else. It is making some of my friends and I happier and it feels like it is time to package it up and test it outside my network to get more feedback.

Next steps: finish off auto-export feature, break the first time user experience into smaller projects, start cranking.
