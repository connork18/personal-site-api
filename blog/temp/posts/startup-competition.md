As I was changing my scraping job for The Current, I was served an advertisement on their website for a startup competition called the Next Challenge for media/journalism startups. I thought: "I *think* that's me!"

So, I am using this opportunity to narrow my focus on the radio station use case.

My highest priority is crafting a compelling application pitch. 

After that, my priority is fixing some bugs and iterating on the design to reduce the friction in the funnel from download to getting users to do what my 5 returning playlist users are doing--creating a playlist based on radio shows/DJs.

BUT- this approach could be wrong, and I want to be very deliberate about not eroding value that these users are experiencing today. By narrowing the focus, I may end up eroding value that other users who don't care about the radio stations are getting. But I am already not engaging those users very much, so my impression is that it doesn't really matter. 

It will be hard for me to let go of my vision to turn individuals into DJs, but I think this is the right approach for now. Right now, I believe that getting a thing that people use is the most important thing I can do not just for this project, but for my development as an entrepreneur.
