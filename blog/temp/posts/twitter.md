If I deactivated my twitter, what would the impact be to my probabilities of success as an entrepeneur?

I signed up for twitter while working in product management at Roblox. I followed some important community members to keep tabs on what is going on. I have never posted on this account. I just read tweets. 

After quitting Roblox, I switched the people I follow to be radio stations/DJs, entrepreneurs, and  some VC folks. Recently, I have been following more indie hacker folks and crypto/web3 folks.

Like other social media apps, it has become another thing I need to exercise will power against. 

I am on a lonely quest. I encounter problems and feelings of self-doubt all of the time. I am constantly looking for answers, and that drives my motivation behind scrolling twitter. 

I am searching for answers because every once in awhile (maybe 1 in 2000?) there is a sentence or thread that feels like what I wanted to hear. The yield on this time spent scrolling, however, is not good.

When I am on top of my mental and physical health though, the will power thing isn't really an issue. 

I know social media is important as a business/brand builder. Being aware of how the platforms work, how people are using it,Â what makes content good or bad, etc is important for effective usage as a brand builder.

I think the answer is: deactivating might have a small net positive impact, but the causal impact is negligble. The biggest impact is actually physical and mental health, and weakness in that area can lead to higher usage in social media and brain-wasting distractions.
