Last week's summary and this week's plan!

Frontseat

 * Last week
    * Worked 27 hours on Frontseat (short of my goal of 36, but got sick)
    * Shipped a filter the home screen feature + new filter UI + genre filters. (awesome!)
    * No customer interviews--one of them got rescheduled and I failed to find a second person.

 * This week
    * Work at least 30 hours on Frontseat doing whatever feels like the most fun.
    * Ship to the app store at least once.
    * 2 customer interviews (need to start working on scheduling my 2nd one tomorrow)

Personal

 * Last week
    * Had a great call with Calvin, the CTO of SixFeetUp and IndyPy meetup.
    * Exercised 3 times (got sick, but still... not what I'd like).
    * No dice on landscaping quote--didn't feel like a priority.

 * This week
    * GET HEALTHY.
    * Set aside extra time to hang out with Lena once I am healthy.
