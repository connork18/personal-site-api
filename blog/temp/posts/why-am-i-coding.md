Why am I writing code to build my product right now (instead of pursuing other "lean" methods like prototyping, etc)?

1) I validated the usefulness of a scrappy version on myself, and I am trying to distribute that experience to others.

2) I want to learn how to build my own products. I like coding, I think it is valuable, and I want to be good at it. I am following my interests.

3) Some level of code is the only way for this to work. I may be overcoding (i.e. creating an app may be overkill, and I could potentially validate ideas faster with web development) but my target customers use their phones a lot and this seems like a good way to meet them where they are.

I did not validate business concepts before coding, which is typically a no-no. This is a highly risky business venture, but it is not a terrible first one.

There are people signing up for and using my product. For someone that has only been coding seriously for 6 months, that is pretty fun and cool.

C'est la vie -- here I will stay until I am not having fun / motivated anymore based on halting user traction or financial pressure.
