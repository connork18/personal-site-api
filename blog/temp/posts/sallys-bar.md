Some thoughts I have on work, none of which are original.

Work is something we spend a large portion of our days doing and is therefore something I believe is important for us to get "right".

It is an investment of time that we do to yield some return.

Some jobs, like typical 9-5s, provide very short term returns in the form of a bi-weekly paycheck. The 9-5 can provide you relevant "experience", or past examples of success/competency. It can also reward you with relevant acquired knowledge. This knowledge can empower you to make money in your 9-5's field indendently of that particular job.

That last piece of your compensation--acquired relevant knowledge--is a big deal. It can lead to future earnings that far outweigh near term paychecks.

The dream is to spend our "work" time doing something that looks like work to others and feels like play to us.

When I am coding and building my app, I am having an awesome time. Building a successful product is one big puzzle. When my student achieves a breakthrough, it feels like a huge victory.

Sometimes I find myself thinking about work when I wish I wasn't--specifically, during my workouts, household tasks or family time. This can be really distracting, counterproductive and not fun.

Recently, I have been trying a new tactic. When I am exercising or whatever and work creeps into my brain, I remind myself that my work is just an f-ing game and that it really doesn't matter. All that actually matters right now is getting in great shape, being healthy, and spending quality time with my family. My work literally doesn't matter at all.

That has been really helpful in getting me to focus on my workouts, and I also think it is true! Relative to those things, it is not important.

But whenever I get the opportunity to dig in to my work, I have a great time. 

A burden of making your play your work is that it can consume your thoughts and eat into the things that matter more. To combat this, I have actively tried to "put it in its place" when I am feeling it intrude my thoughts. When I employ this tactic, it has had all the positive benefits of "living in the moment" without any negative benefits of losting work motivation.

Anyway that sort of stuff has been on my mind, and this evening I went to Sally's Bar in St. Mary's, Indiana and had several beers--it's time for bed.
