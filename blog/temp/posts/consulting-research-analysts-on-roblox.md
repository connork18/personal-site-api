I get a lot of requests to consult with investment analysts on Roblox / metaverse / gaming platforms. I haven't done one yet.

An intermediary recently sent me a list of high level questions, looking for brief answers prior to starting an engagement. Here are a list of those questions and some personal answers. There are some market research reports that may have different answers, but this is based on my observations and experience. 

 * What are the key success factors for developing a game for the platform you have worked for?

    Understanding the audience, leveraging different creators/specialists to bring a complete game experience to life, having expertise with the platform to produce and test different gaming concepts rapidly, capitalizing on broader internet media entertainment trends, building a community and social element into the core game mechanic, having a presence in the community and leveraging it to get early feedback, and building relationships with channel partners like influencers.

 * What are the key growth trends in the online gaming market?
    
    Ignoring the unpredictable near term COVID-related swings with people's online engagement, I see a few trends contributing to growth:

    1. Improved devices and connectivity: An increasing amount of gaming today is done on people's mobile devices in an internet-connected way. The majority of the world does not have access to the high end devices and fast internet that can support rich gaming experiences. Improved technology and adoption will both expand the addressable market, engagement per player and spend.

    2. Gaming --> Experiences: There are only so many people that choose video games as their entertainment method of choice. The types of rich interactive experiences and what classifies as "gaming" has already been expanding. Making these unique kinds of virtual experiences accessible and desirable outside historical gaming consumers may drive a larger market. Gaming platforms feel best positioned to capitalize on that opportunity given they have already made significant progress on the required infrastructure and experience serving 3D experiences in real-time physics environments at massive scale (which is extremely complex).

    3. Interoperability: People sink huge amounts of time into these experiences. The ability to tie gaming achievements to your identity that persists around the internet and beyond will increase relevance and overall spend.

    4. Brands: It is difficult today for brands to drive (or at least measure) ROI by sponsoring and advertising in games that competes with other marketing channels. The in-game advertising market is small relative to the digital advertising market. As the types of immersive experiences available evolve and more and more people spend time in these experiences, advertisers will need to figure out how to be present. I imagine they will allocate more and more of their marketing dollars to the owners of these experiences in order to keep mindshare with their audience. 

 * What are the revenue trends from in-app purchases of the games?
    
    At the highest level, there are in-app purchases that improve the functional game experience (via pay-to-win, hiding advertising, unlocking new capabilites/features) and cosmetic add-ons (i.e. "skins"). Cosmetic add-ons are becoming increasingly popular because they represent the players' identity, status and accomplishments while maintaining the integrity of the experience. 

    New, open economies have started to unlock interesting dynamics like "play-to-earn", where in-game achievements unlock attractive rewards for players that they can then turn around and sell to other players who may be willing to pay for these rewards/cosmetic items without having to have developed the skill or sunk the time to achieve them. However--this is still relatively small.

 * What are the differences from platform to platform?

    The definition of "platform" here can be a little subjective. I am going to define it as a company/product that enables game developers to both build AND distribute games. 
    
    The ones at the most massive scale are Roblox, Epic (Fortnite), Minecraft (by Microsoft) and Apple/Google. There are others that have only creation toolsets or only distribution or others that are not at massive scale. 
    
    The major differences are how integrated their creation and distribution offerings are, how advanced their creation toolset is, the business models of the platform, their backend/infrastructure support for the devs (or lack thereof), and the revenue sharing arrangement with devs. 

 * How easy is it to change platforms?

    It is not easy to switch platforms, although the degree to which it is easy to switch varies platform to platform. In Roblox's history, there have only been one or two successful games (to my knowledge!) that have successfully switched platforms in an effort to increase their revenue share and distribution outside of the Roblox ecosystem, none of which have been overwhelming and enduring successes. Many of the top Roblox developers began developing on Roblox when they were kids (9-14) and are now in their 20s. Over time, developers become experts in the toolsets and potentially even more important, they develop specific customer insight on what works for the players they can access through each platform.

 * How is the cooperation between platforms and developers?

    For Roblox, the coordination is limited. "Respect the community" is a core value of Roblox, but each area of the product has a small team of people supporting it and millions of players and creators using it and pushing it to its limits. Roblox does their best to respond to feedback and bake needs into their platform, but ultimately there is only so much they can do at a given time. Roblox is both a distributor and a supplier to their developer community. The game developers are not employees. That said, Roblox wants to share as much revenue as possible with their developer community while maintaining their margins, because they know that their developers drive the success of the platform. 
    
    In general, this developers<>platform relationship is fairly common for large scale platforms. They list and try to influence their roadmap accordingly, but there are lots of stakeholders and everyone is not 100% happy all of the time.
