I have 3 "every week" users, and I am optimistic about my shot at getting 5 by the end of the year!!

When I came into this year still working at Roblox, my goals for Frontseat were (in this order of priority):

 1. <strong>Become a sustainable development unit.</strong> I spent money on freelance engineers in 2020 and overbuilt, overspent, undervalidated, etc, etc. So I learned to code because I like it and I knew it was necessary to the kind of capital-efficient, long-term focused technology entrepreneur I want to be. I have accomplished this goal.

 2. <strong>5 retained users.</strong> I have tweaked this further to be "Get 5 <u> every week users</u>". Right now, I have 3 users that have used it two weeks in a row and several others in the pipeline. In total, I have 15 "returning" users in the app, but actually listening to the playlists you are generating is the down-funnel value prop that I am measuring myself by.

 3. <strong>10 paying customers</strong> This I was not expecting to be able to hit this year. I could see it becoming the single goal of mine for all of 2022. I have had lots of thoughts on the path to get here, but in the meantime, I am focused on trying to accompish goal #2. 

I am incredibly proud of creating a piece of software that 3 people in my community are relying on every week to discover music and connect with people close to them.

But I know that if I don't keep making improvements, I could lose these people tomorrow. So back to work!
