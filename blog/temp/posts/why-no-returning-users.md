title: 'Why I do not have returning users'

I was asked by someone recently why I think I haven't accomplished my goal of 5 organically retained users with Frontseat. 

Currently, Frontseat has 59 users that have signed up and 38 users that have authenticated their account with Spotify. 

These users comprise of one of the following groups: 

* friends I think are in my target market that have generously lent their attention over the past year or so
* friends I think are outside my target market that have signed up out of intrigue
* one or two people that have been recommended to check it out by an existing user, and
* a few random people that I don't know who have stumbled upon it and immediately churned after signing up.

My answer to the question of why 5 of these users are coming back to the app consistently was that it is due to a few factors.

First, the feature set isn't deep enough. I am in the process of rebuilding the app, which meant starting with a more stripped down version than I had in the last version. The software is currently more functional, but less powerful than it previously was. This is (hopefully) temporary and it is improving. I, for one, am not using the app as consistently as I would like to if it had some of the features I have on the roadmap.

Second, the first time user experience is bad and bordering on offensive. This prevents people that my existing users rely on for music recommendations from joining the app, which in turn makes the app less valuable to them. A new user has to expend an unreasonable and virtually impossible amount of time and effort - - both on and off the app - - in order to get some value. This is an area where I have a significant product experience gap. Roblox almost takes pride in its amazing success despite the lack of a true first time user experience, but this app is **NOT** Roblox (lol). Even in its most ideal and optimistic state, it will never yield an average 2 hours of engagement / DAU. It is a solution that strives to deliver fast value, saving people time and allowing them to live more fulfilling lives. This goal is not evident based on the current first time user experience.

Third, the problem I am solving has what I am calling extremely thin "time economics." I believe that the average target user has very little time that they are willing to spend on a solution to the problem I am solving before they "settle" for a less optimal solution. In some cases, it can be just a few seconds. This is what most indie hackers are taught to avoid like the plague. Solving an important problem gives you a bigger margin of error in usability and a higher likelihood of getting paying customers.

The third point is the existential threat to the project. It is particularly challenging because it makes it difficult to know whether additional features and improved usability design can help you cross that chasm of breaking into consumer's headspace or whether the amount of time and effort it would take to crack that approaches years / never.

I take comfort in seeing lots of other apps out there - - some with lots of success but not at large scale - - trying to solve the same problem that I am in a slightly different way. This helps me validate that the problem has some reasonable level of importance to warrant significant time/money investments from others in building apps and attention and feedback from customers.

I also came into this project knowing that the cards are stacked against me in this way. I want to be able to build a tech-driven product and business from 0 to 1 by myself, and while this is a hard problem to solve, it is a product that I myself want to exist in the world. I believe the customer insights I will gain from pursuing a market and problem of this nature will benefit whatever I end up taking on next.

(Now that I have rationalized my irrational pursuit...)

I think that the biggest failure of my current app at the moment is the first time user experience. It is what I am going to address next. It is embarrassing enough that it does not make sense for anyone - - including me (which is a real problem) - - to recommend it to someone else. 

My initial "marketing" efforts are going to be targeted customer onboarding interviews as a way of both getting fresh feedback and getting new users. I am planning to do this in pairs so that people have someone whose taste in music they trust on the app right away.

So my current goal is building a first time user experience that makes me comfortable conducting those interviews, and as a side effect, will hopefully make existing users and any interviewed users more likely to recommend it to their friends (and thus making the app more valuable).

Today, I am going to try to line up some customer interviews in about two weeks time. I will do a development sprint to tackle a list of the most important issues necessary to give that a shot at 1) soliciting useful feedback and 2) maybe getting them started on a solution they enjoy.
