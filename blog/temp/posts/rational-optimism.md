A couple of "lossess" I am feeling at the moment:

I missed a meeting with target user today (a friend to my wife and me). It sucked, and I was very embarrassed.
 * I am lucky that she is so patient and nice. She offered to try again tomorrow. 
 * Hopefully this mistake prevents me from doing this again in the future. 

I rearchitected a large portion of the app's code and still don't have the feature that I tried to clear the way for--filtering the home screen.
 * I did a ton of code cleanup and was also able to improve several other things along the way.
 * Rather than waiting for the filter home screen feature to be done, I took my own advice and shipped these incremental changes.

<a href="https://nav.al/optimism">Naval</a> had a quote on why rational optimism is "the way" for entrepreneurs. 

I like the term and think it fits well here (even if his use of it was kind of different).

Being rationally optimistic doesn't mean that the "losses" I mentioned don't suck or feel shitty. They do--especially the first one.

I don't believe that identifying opportunities in roadblocks and missteps is a fluffy thing. You can still take it on the chin and say that hurts or is frustrating but at least I can correct my behavior now and/or create something better as a result.
