title: 'Another case for new users'

After pushing a new feature and discovering a ton of new music as a result, I am back to thinking about the first time user experience.

I have been thinking about another benefit to getting more users on the app - - more feedback!

I know that there are lots of flaws in my assumptions about what users want and what my app offers. And I think feedback is the magic ticket to correcting those assumptions.

Currently, I rely on my small group of friends/family that loosely fit profiles of who I think my target users are for periodic feedback. That feedback is fairly sparse. Nobody's core business or personal source of entertainment depends deeply on my app (which I hope I do not describe about my next business venture). This means this project is rarely if ever top of mind. Frontseat as designed today is a tool that attempts to lift up your day to day life experience (listening to better music) with minimal effort.

What is absolutely true is that I do not have a product that my 5 to 10 target people are attached to, although I have seen signals of week over week retention. And when I sit with that truth, I feel convinced that I should be prioritizing improvements (or even changes) to the core product experience rather than the onboarding of new users. 

But maybe if I could get a higher volume of customer feedback I could more efficiently prioritize the right things? That would be great, but buying some ads on Instagram or something could yield some signups + silence. That means more work to set up feedback channels on our website (which barely exists today) or app. 

Alternatively, I could pursue building a product that a non-radio business would be willing to promote to its customers. Businesses that are also tastemaker-y are great candidates because music is not their core product. It is basically effortless and free for them to create an account and no ongoing time investment. I could provide posters to them, and if I am lucky, they might promote it on social media. I might have to pay for this exposure, but someday it could be worth it. And working with these small businesses could be great general product feedback channels, as the owners of the types of businesses I would target are probably big music fans themselves.

Alternatively alternatively, I could set up shop and work at places like Square Cat Vinyl sometime with a little poster hanging off my table. "Building a music discovery app and need feedback! I will buy you a coffee."

I think these are all actually pretty good and fun ideas and that I should experiment with all three.

I know I want to introduce automatically updating playlists based on filters before I switch to the first time user experience, and that I would prefer to have the first time user experience acceptable before I experiment with these <del>marketing</del> feedback channels.

Seems like a decent plan of attack, we will see what happens.
