I have spent the last several days getting feedback through talking to users and mentors and drafting an essay on my path forward. The essay was helpful for clarifying my thoughts, but my thoughts were changing so rapidly that my essay couldn't keep up.

It is crazy how much my thinking evolves with every new conversation and/or day of reflecting.

I scrapped the essay and came away with this.

My current thoughts about what my process should look like right now:
 * Focus my energies on customers/product--I can never talk to my users enough
 * Narrowing my focus will help me strengthen my value proposition, simplify the product and clarify marketing/pitch
 * Focus on making the product better for my existing users and ALSO increasing the likelihood of making new users happy
 * I don't need traditional ads/marketing right now, other than for the sake of experimentation / incentivizing myself to improve the onboarding flow
 * The best feedback comes from new target users in the form of interviews and observing them onboard
 * Onboarding is hugely important in consumer apps--add value to users ASAP in that process
 * Small, meaningful changes in the right direction are better than large scale starting over--don't avoid rework

My current thoughts on my product and approach:
 * The people closest to paying for my product are those that are generating playlists based on radio stations
 * My vision is to uplift music explorers across spectrum--from individuals to professional organzations
 * I don't think my "feed" can compete with traditional social media products with the "entertain me while I kill time" job
 * The jobs I think that I can compete with are: 
   * "deliver recommendations to me where I want them"
   * "help me get more out of radio stations I like"
   * "help me find/filter specific music I want"
   * "help me feel learn more about myself and my music"
 * My current product helps me discover music from explorers I like, but it does not engage them
 * The explorers I like all wish they could be radio DJs in another life, but don't have the time, resources or energy
 * Being radio DJs would help them share cool music, feel good that people like their taste in music, and connect with cool people who share their taste
 * Serving these explorers and making them feel like radio DJs without expending the effort is an opportunity I want to pursue
 * ^^ that sounds like a higher risk endeavor and should treated secondary relative to radio stations

My current plan:
 * Experiment with a protoype that removes the feed and instead focuses on viewing profiles and generating playlists
 * My primary focus will be on helping people get the most out of the radio stations I have on the app
 * Start talking to radio DJs and learn more about them and the challenges that they face
 * Talk to other explorers on the app and further validate my "they want to be a DJ" hypothesis
