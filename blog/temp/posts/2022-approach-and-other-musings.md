Exercise, Serve and Create everyday. That is my 2022 approach.

Yesterday I was sick and that was a big bummer. 

When I am exercising regularly, everything else just flows. 

When I can't exercise (because of being sick or otherwise) my mojo starts to slow. In these cases, the advice I'd like to give myself is to take a "do your best" approach. Go to sleep, don't stay up. Mind your diet. Don't get lazy. 

I have very "all or nothing" tendencies, where if I am not following a program or regimen, it's not worth trying. Although I know that is not true. 


Teaching!

It has been so fulfilling (and also wickedly challenging and intellectually stimulating) to spend the time trying to serve my students. 

Helping them and providing advice to them doesn't mean I'm not figuring stuff out too. I'm validating a startup idea and figuring out my long term thing while teaching my course. 

Building in public tranferred to the teaching world is interesting. Most teachers probably don't offer that level of vulnerability while teaching students.

One of my life principles is that vulnerability is a superpower. Not sure how it translates here. Do you lose credibility? Idk. 

Advice I would give myself--take less real estate in conversations. More research, more questions.
