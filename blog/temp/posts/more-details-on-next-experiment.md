Here is a little more detail behind my next product experiment.

<strong>Assumption:</strong> 

Existing fans of radio stations that like particular shows/DJs will enjoy a product that creates and maintains playlists based on these DJs shows and are willing to pay for it.

<strong>Experiment: </strong>

Re-work my app to 
  1. focus on playlist generation flow during onboarding
  2. have core, returning experience help users manage playlists, create new ones, and explore stations

Test the new experience with >= 2 target customers that are fans of shows.

See if they like and use the experience and are willing to pay for it.

<h3>Conduct these interviews by December 3rd! (giving myself 4 weeks)

<strong>Upcoming tasks: </strong>
  * Fix my radio station scraping script
  * Design an MVP of this new app experience
  * Scope incremental tasks required to achieve that experience

<strong>Questions I am asking myself</strong>
  * How hard should I commit to this new approach? Should I delete anything that is not aligned with this value proposition?
    * I am not going to be afraid to delete and simplify things that are getting in the way of this new design and experiment.
    * I am going to try not to delete anything just for the sake of minimizing future problems yet. 
    * If I validate that this new hypothesis is on the right track, then I can consider deleting things not aligned with it to minimize future problems/distractions.
    * I am going to move as incrementally as possible and do what I can to validate along the way rather than wait 4 weeks to get feedback.
  
  * Would it be easier to do this with a simple website instead of reworking my mobile app?
    * Maybe. But I am faster and more familiar with mobile development at this stage than web frontend. 
    * Getting this done as fast as possible feels like the highest priority.
