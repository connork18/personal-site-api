Ship it

I have been working on this latest version of the app and it is basically ready. 

I need to ship it, and get feedback and figure out what works and what doesn't and what needs more attention.

I made a ton of progress today. I need to focus and do everything I can to get it submitted to the app store tonmorrow. 

5 returning users before the EOY would be SOOOO AWESOMEE!!!
