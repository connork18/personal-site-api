My startup pitch is becoming clearer.

The reason I exist is to help beloved music curators keeping creating for their audiences.

I do this by:
 * helping them do more with less
 * helping them monetize their audience

I see both sides of this market--the curators and their audiences--exist in abundance, but there is so much friction that exists in the middle, namely time, costs and consummability.

And my goal is to build something that closes this gap.

I also need to do a bit of writing for the marketing of my Guided Entrepreneurship course. 

Once my startup pitch and course marketing blurb are complete, I will post them here.
