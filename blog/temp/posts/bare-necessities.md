This is a concept I have thought about several times recently, so I'm writing it down.

Boiling things down to their bare essentials is both very hard and very valuable.

I've found it applicable to many things, including building a happy + healthy life. I have also encountered it frequently in my journey to launch a startup.

Somewhat related -- I want to solve an important problem with any business I launch. Part of this journey I am on in this exploratory part of the process is trying to discover an important, specific problem that we want to go solve.

I have 3 meetings with prospective customers where I am looking for verbal commitments to pilot an early version of our product/service. 

I find myself wondering whether any of them are going to say "yes". They are small brands in competitive markets with a million things going on and limited resources. I am selling a way to break through the noise that I believe will work and am giving them a great deal to test it out. 

I am an optimist, but I am also an economist. I'm prepared to let the market decide whether this is an important enough problem to solve. 

But I will be doing everything I can to give the idea it's fair day in court. 

And in an attempt to tie this back to the original topic of this post--getting a "yes" is the absolute most important thing I can be doing right now. Anything that assumes a "yes" or doesn't increase the likelihood of getting a "yes" should probably be paused this week (e.g. building the product to fulfill the "yes"...)
