Did some things, learned some stuff and had some thoughts:
 * I shipped a change that makes connecting your Spotify account a deliberate part of the onboarding flow. I did not realize how useful the app could still be without authenticating with Spotify. I am glad I worked on that.

 * I started to make some changes to the People screen. These will be transferrable to the onboarding flow as well. I need to ensure that the design is intentional and not hacked together.

 * I have an idea for a video to promote Frontseat that would be really entertaining and involve a bit of a collaboration. That is the type of marketing I am excited about and that I have historically been good at. This excites and motivates me to do some of the boring things I need to do in order to make that possible (website, legal documents, additional settings, performance fixes, UX flow improvements).

 * I have some meetings coming up with people that have experience in areas I do not. I could really use advice and I need to be efficient with their time. In an ideal world, I would send some slides over ahead of time to demonstrate the app, my tech stack and my thoughts on the future.

 * I am starting to think that there is a missing kink to my experience, and that is user<>user communication. My hypothesis is that it would be sparked by a user seeing that a user they follow listened to a particular track. In its simplest form, this would be a "like", or possibly a choice from a set of different reactions. In its ideal form, it would include a form of private or semi-private messaging or threads. The content available on my app is not available anywhere else (detailed, filterable listening history). It has the potential to spark lots of conversations and connections. Today, I accomplish this by occasionally screenshotting and annotating and sending via iPhone messages to my friend who I saw listened to an awesome track. My wife's sisters have done this too as a joke when my sister-in-law played the Sesame Street song over 200 times while nannying. Several other users have asked if they could occasionally comment on songs or send music back and forth. I wonder whether I could do this without using real-time chat channels and just simple HTTP and push notifications. I also wonder whether I should just add some sort of reaction button and the ability to share the frontseat ListenedTrack instance to messages and that building a full fledged feature is overkill. If I do it with simple HTTP/database stuff I don't think it would be that cumbersome. We'll see.
