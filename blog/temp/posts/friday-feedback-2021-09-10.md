I interviewed and onboarded a user (friend), and here are my abbreviated notes:
 * Listens to indie pop + post-punk rock, as well as some other genres that she considers guilty pleasures to varying degrees
 * Goes through waves of listening to new music vs. tried and true favorites
 * Has notifications on for alerts on artists new songs
 * When discovering, her formula is:
    * check out discover weekly or other personalized playlists (which she is generally not super satisfied with)
    * when she finds a song that sounds like something new and cool, she checks out the artist radio
    * if she likes it, she also checks out the similar artists
    * she has a few close friends whose taste she trusts that recommend her good music
 * When authenticating with Spotify, she wanted to confirm that listening in private mode on Spotify translates to this app as well
 * First thing she did was create a new feed
    * the message said "No songs returned. Follow friends and refresh!"
    * if possible, it would be great to have the listEmptyComponent be a button that says "Follow Friends" that launches you into the People tab.
 * Wanted to filter by genre (I am going to do that next!!)
 * When editing filters, she assumed that she could press the back button instead of "save" in order for the new filters to be maintained.
 * The floating action buttons at the bottom were very much off the radar. This is consistent with our previous customer interviews
 * Exporting the feed to a playlist was a huge benefit, she said she would probably listen to that playlist that day.
 * Forgot to highlight the auto-export feature, but it didn't jump off the page b/c I also hadn't introduced the export floating action button
 
 Very successful and lots of good feedback. I need to do this at least once a week.
