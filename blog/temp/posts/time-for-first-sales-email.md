I have completed and submitted to app stores the filter-by-radio-station feature. It is being used by me and, as of today, my one target user that is a devout fan of a radio station on the platform. I made one more person just a little bit happier.

Today, I also delivered updates to the way I manage local/global state and the plays_by_user field in my feed queries. I started work on the auto-export to playlists feature (but ignored the business email).

I think that this business account email is important. Rather than waiting for a time when the first time user experience is perfect or the app is more polished or something, I feel like I should just go for it. I am still deep in customer discovery mode. I could have real, possibly paying customers pull the right feature prioritization out of me, or I could just push my best guess onto them. The former feels like the intelligent thing to pursue in this scenario.

So I am going to prioritize the email to this business prospect tomorrow. Short, clear and personal.
