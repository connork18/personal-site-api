"Listen to better music."

I have been listening to "This is Marketing" by Seth Codin. He talks about appealing to the need your customer has instead of focusing on the product itself.

The idea for Frontseat originated as a tool that makes my life better by efficiently giving me a high volume of better music.

My definition of better music was primarily music sourced by people I trust, namely my favorite radio stations and friends.

The tactic that made sense and served that need for me was a dump of the raw activity from people I trust that I can then sift through myself.

All things equal, I wanted music that my friends liked to be the deciding factor instead of Spotify commercial interests. And I did not want to be trapped by an algorithm that had a tough time keeping up with my diverse artistic tastes and was incentivized to not take as many risks.

I have known that I eventually want to add listening stats to Frontseat. I have a great tool to do it based on the infrastructure I have built. And while my theory that listening stats would be a features that made sense alongside my listening activity feeds, I have been struggling to find the words or mission that brings them together.

Filtered activity feeds, auto-generated playlists and listening stats are all tools that can help you <b>listen to better music</b>. Your listening stats can be a tool to help reward you for listening to full albums, discovering new artists and keeping music a part of your life. It can also add motivation to follow and test out music that your friends are discovering.

The only thing I don't like about "Listen to better music" is that it implies you may not be listening to the right music, which has a little bit of a negative vibe? I also need the people that are listening to great music and discovering it so that their friends can swim in their wake and get recommendations.

I think this is closer than "music you want from sources you trust" ? But maybe not quite there yet. I will keep working on it.
