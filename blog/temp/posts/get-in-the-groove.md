title: 'Getting back in the groove'

I have gotten out of whack on my exercise, serve and create. I aggressively pursued an opportunity to possibly lead a startup. I competed with and lost to someone I hope will be a future friend and that I know will do a great job.

I have lots of things going through my mind on next steps in my entrepreneurial journey, but mostly, I need to get back on top of my health. If I have that right, everything else flows. 

In the past, when I needed to win on something, I through every ounce of energy into it at the expense of health and relationships. At this stage of my life, I wonder if doing that should be a warning sign that perhaps it is not the right opportunity for me? Not sure. 

I have some injuries I'm nursing from a ski trip that I was far too aggressive on. My challenge is going to be getting back into my groove without overdoing it or getting discouraged by injuries.

Other things on my mind once I get that right:
 * building relationships with people that could someday be a great long-term technical co-founder with me
 * preparing to be the initial technical co-founder myself as we get started
 * keeping the wheels turning on web3 experience through launching some small projects
 * figuring out a startup idea worth doing and getting funding for before my future son is born June 8th
