title: 'Beat my fear of writing publicly by doing it every day'

Creating written content and publishing it for the world to see is a very scary thing to me, so I am committing to do it every day for a year in the form of a personal blog (inspired by my friend DK's roadtoramen.com). While scary, I understand the importance and have witnessed lots of people I respect be great at it, and a common thread is consistency. As I get closer to marketing **Frontseat** or any other ventures I pursue, I am going to need to do a lot of creative marketing and put myself and my product out there. (Again - - terrifying!)

My strengths are my ability to be earnest, vulnerable, and disciplined. I have been jumping into the deep end of things at a pretty regular clip for the last decade or so. So my intention is to start exercising my content muscle in a way that is native to me--committing to writing consistently, being as real as humanly possible and figuring it out as I go. 

I intend to focus primarily on my journey with **Frontseat**, the music discovery app I am building. I also see myself sprinkling in talking about my experiences with other projects I am working on (an education experiment) and life areas I am investing in, like fitness, meditation, landscaping/DIY homestuff and of course marriage/fatherhood.

I suppose that this may be a life blog. The primary audience will be 1) me, as a way to organize my thoughts and work through the (many) issues I face on my entrepreneurial journey, and 2) any of the people that have reached out saying that they would love to follow along my journey.
