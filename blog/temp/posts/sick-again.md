I am sick again. I have a fever and it sucks. 

I had COVID a month and a half ago, and it was pretty bad.

This is the worst I have felt since then. I am hoping it is only a day or two kind of thing.

I don't think this is from overworking or anything, but I did start to get out of balance this week. 

I would work right when I woke up, I lost track of time tracking and just wasn't in a very good rhythm. 

Need to prioritize my health!
