I am on a fishing trip and today was the first day. I had a couple of nibbles, but caught nothing. It felt similar to my Frontseat experience.

I experimented with different things and tried to do more of the things that were associated with the times that I had bites. 

But knowing which piece of the puzzle was wrong and by how much was difficult. Is my technique for this kind of fishing wrong? Am I in the wrong part of the lake? Are the windy conditions today just not conducive to catching any fish? Is today just not my day and should I stay patient and keep doing more of the same things while waiting for a good day?

Tomorrow we have fishing guides, which I am hoping will help lead to a more successful outing and knowledge that I can take to the last couple of days of guideless fishing. 

I am not sure whether the startup product analogy applies here. It probably does and it doesn't.
