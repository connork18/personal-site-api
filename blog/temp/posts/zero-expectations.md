"Have zero expectations of others."

This is something I believe is key to living a happy, fulfilled life. It is something I have grown in since I was in high school. But I have had a difficult time creating a framework for how to apply it in day-to-day life situations.

I have heard Gary Vaynerchuck touch on this before. I did a quick search and found that I think sums up what I believe and how I strive to treat myself and others, both in personal relationships and business.
