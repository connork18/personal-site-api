Personal

 * Last week
    * Time tracked all work-related efforts and also exercise, but only exercised 3 times (although I was pretty active on off days).
    * Didn't <i>improve</i> our landscaping, but did do a lot of maintenance work (and made the decision to hire someone to do a big one-time makeover).
    * Cooked dinner more than once, helped Emily with her NFT project but did not get my student to connect with at least two mentors.

 * This week
    * Have a great call with Calvin, the CTO of SixFeetUp
    * Exercise at least 4 times.
    * Identify and send some inbound emails/calls to landscaping companies for quotes.
