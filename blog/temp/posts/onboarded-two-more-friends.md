I onboarded two of my friends who I know to have good taste in music. I was able to gather some additional feedback:
 * They like the app's visual design a lot
 * They would like to be able to filter by genres
 * They wanted to get more of their friends on the app, in particular some of their family members that have been listening to good music but never think to share it
 * They liked the direct links to Spotify and the ability to export feeds to Spotify
 * It took a little bit to understand how the auto-export feature worked, but they liked it
 * They were wanting to tap on usernames and see the profiles of some sort
 * They suggested a home screen that has multiple modules rather than just defaulting to the raw listening activity of everyone that you follow

My takeaways:
 * They are my friends and so I should take positive feedback with a grain of salt
 * I need more feedback
 * My instinct to focus on the home screen and making it as good as possible while requiring minimal effort seems like the right track
 * I should consider doing one of those calls every week where I get people I know that are music fans on the app in order to get more feedback on the first time experience, broaden my existing user feedback pool, and ideally increase the value of the app for existing users by targeting friends of people that are on the app and happy.
