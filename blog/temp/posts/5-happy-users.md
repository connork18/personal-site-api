5 returning (happy) users by 12/31/21.

That is my singular focus for Frontseat.

I instrumented analytics to finally start getting accurate numbers on that, as well as other analytics.

Then I will chip away at barriers and get as much feedback as I can to identify with more confidence what the real barriers are.
