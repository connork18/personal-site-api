I did not exercise today, and despite it being a weird day where we traveled from Indianapolis, I got almost 7 hours of work in. 

I woke up at 6:30am and was able to get just over an hour of work done before anyone else woke up.

But... I didn't work out at all today. My energy levels were pretty blah and I can't afford that. I am working on two difficult of problems that require a lot of concentration and creative thinking.

I did publish my new people tab experience to the app stores. I really want to get a version of my home screen filters out before the weekend, and need my energy to be top notch.

I came up with what I think is an adequate design by poking around in the code base and testing some things out, but I am still going to have to work out a pretty hairy circular reference bug in my backend tomorrow.

I also have a meeting with the CTO of SixFeetUp, a client-serving software company that is the founder of the local IndyPy group, next Monday 9/13. 

It would be great to get these changes out before I meet with him so I can focus on prepping, but not at the expense of bad code. 

My health is critical to my long-term happiness and my success. I want to be the type of person that doesn't miss workouts for anything. My energy and stamina, problem solving abilities, and code base all depend on it :)

I am going to really focus on being "on it" the rest of the week.
