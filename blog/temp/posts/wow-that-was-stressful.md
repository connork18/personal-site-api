Yesterday I increased my total number of reach outs to 35. It was stressful work! 

For one, it involves a lot of time spent on social media where there are so many distractions. 

Spending an entire day on social media sites is enough to fry the brain of just about anybody.

My funnel so far is:
* 35 reach outs
* 3 responses
* 3 sign ups (8.5% vs. 4%)
* 3 playlists created (8.5% vs. 3%)
* 0 playlist listeners
* ? weekly retained users (? vs. 0.1%)

So far, this is better than my assumption. My assumption is that the weekly retained user % is pretty pitiful (0.1% of reach outs).

One of the responses was someone I had already spoken with extensively about the product. He asked a few questions which were really helpful feedback points.

My next milestone is 50 reach outs. After I get to 50, I'd like to reevaluate my reach out strategy and see if there is any further value I can provide to these potential customers.
