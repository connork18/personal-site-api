title: 'Talking to users to test assumptions'

After asking one target user that fits my bill of my narrower focus whether they would be willing to pay for the existing service, they said:

<i>"I would consider it. I used Spotify for quite awhile before I finally decided to pay the monthly premium. I've never regretted that decision. I think you need to dangle incentives that eventually become too muhc to resist."</i>

I should ask all of my users this question. I don't think I can ever talk to my users too much.

Going through the below exercise, which is how I started this post, helped make that clear:

What are my key business assumptions?

 * Consumers are willing to pay for something that helps them discover music from their favorite sources
 * Radio stations and DJs are willing share the information necessary to provide that extension of their service
 * The revenue possible in the run rate of this business is higher than the costs required to run and yield a return

How can I test to see whether users are willing to pay?

 * Ask them.
 * Charge them.
 * Offer life-time deals, where users pay a one time fee and then become Frontseat Supporters for the life of the product.
 * Make the app cost money to download, invest more heavily in marketing language, see if anyone comes into the app.
 * Build the payments page on my website and/or in-app purchase product so I can more effectively run these tests.

How can I simplify my product without eroding value?

 * Get rid of comments or any features that nobody is using.
 * Ask people that are using a feature I want to remove whether the replacement solution will fit their needs.
 * Ship incremental improvements and ask people to try them out and provide feedback.
 * Nothing is a one-way door -- make the change and test it out and see how it works.
