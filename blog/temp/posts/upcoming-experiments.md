Application aside, I am trying to validate two key assumptions right now:

 1. existing radio fans will pay for something that helps them get more value from their stations

 2. DJs/professional curators actually have a business need/interest in a solution

I am running the following experiments in the next 3-4 weeks:

 1. Deliver an MVP of a MUCH simpler product solely focused on getting fans of existing stations to generate refreshing playlists of shows they follow. Targeting Eric heppner and Scott McCorkle. See if they will pay for the product.

 2. Interview at least 5 music curators to assess their needs and challenges and get feedback on my idea. Do they have a real business problem that needs solved?
