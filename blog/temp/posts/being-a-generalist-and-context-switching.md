title: 'Being a generalist and context switching'

I consider myself a passionate generalist. I have experience in the finance and investment side of business, I have experience in the product side of business and I am coming up the curve on the engineering side of business.

When I was in college and had my first internship at a local two-person investment management shop, I fell in love with something the founder said. It is a little fuzzy, but I asked him something like "what do you like the most about your job" and he said something that included <strong>"figuring out how the world works."</strong>

That resonated so deeply with me. I consider my career and life a never-ending quest for figuring out how the world works. 

Career-wise, this can pose some interesting trade-offs... 

I have shyed away from deep specialization. This has driven me towards startup land, where wearing lots of different hats is a competitive advantage.

I have given up lots of (near-term?) $$$ for the sake of pursuing that quest at an extreme level. 

While investing hard in a new skillset--building--and creating an app on my own, I realized how fulfilling it is to serve and be useful. This informed my Exercise + Serve + Create framework I am using for 2022. 

Since leaving Roblox, I have been writing code in the following languages:
 * Python
 * Javscript
 * Lua
 * Solidity
 * Postgresql (not technically a programming language, but has required similar investments based on the complex data apps I have developed)

I have been using the following frameworks/tools/platforms:
 * Django
 * Nextjs
 * Bootstrap
 * React Native
 * AWS (EC2, RDS, EB, others)
 * Roblox Studio
 * Google Analytics/Firebase
 * Xcode
 * Android Studio
 * Blender
 * Pixlr
 * Figma

Sometimes I wonder whether I should reduce the number of tools I am using and learn how to do more those few tools?

On the other hand, reducing my tools might mean limiting the problem spaces. An example--if I decided to become an expert Django developer, that would come at the expense of being fluent in Solidity (at least in the near/intermediate term) and web3 has been feeling like the right lane for me. 

Another thought--getting good at context switching and refamiliarization may just be showbiz.

An example: in investment banking, if you haven't been in the weeds developing the model for awhile, you need some time to refamiliarize yourself. Or if you are in sales, refamiliarizing yourself with a client. I know the same thing applies in software.

Rather than wasting time complaining about context switching and letting that influence your behavior, is the best approach to just say "I am going to get fucking good at context switching"?

Maybe this is a problem that you just let you natural instincts and decision making model take the wheel? Not sure.

I <strong>think</strong> I fall in the camp of "embrace context switching". As a father, husband and founder, that sounds like a skill that benefits the people I aspire to serve.

Also--I find that when I just suck it up and dive in, it is rarely as difficult as the initial "wtf is going on here" feeling I have when opening something up.
