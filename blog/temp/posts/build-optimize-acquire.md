Building -- Optimizing -- Acquiring

These are the axes that I am applying myself on. 

I have been indexed heavily on the Optimizing axis recently. But I feel ready to <b>slowly</b> increase the weighting on the Acquiring and Building index.

Most of my efforts have a flavor of all three. I still think my next project will look more like optimizing than acquiring, but they will be geared more towards net new users.

I made a lot of progress on some true optimizing work today and am very happy with the direction I landed on after hacking around quite a bit. 

But I also started to really feel the diminishing returns of true experience optimization (how much time am I willing to spend on a disappearing subheader and customly configuring animations, etc. Is that really going to be the deciding factor of product / market fit?)

I think that I will split my time over acquire/optimize work and build/optimize work, helping increase the likelihood of a stranger having a good experience and also exposing some features that are cheap to provide and make the experience richer.

I have been trying out a new signal for whether my priorities are correct -- what sounds like the most fun. Shifting towards acquire/optimize and build/optimize work sounds fun!
