I put lots of pressure on myself.

I have been trained my whole life to compare myself with others and compete.

Near-term positive feedback and pats on the back have been my fuel for a long time.

I knew that this jump to an independent creator and entrepreneur was going to be painful and uncomfortable.

I have a vision for myself that is far away from current reality and is going to take time, effort and extraordinary patience to realize.

If I was 90 years old, I think I would encourage myself to have fun, learn, focus on my health, serve others and everything else would take care of itself. 

Is there any advice I should listen to more than my 90-year old self? I don't think so.
