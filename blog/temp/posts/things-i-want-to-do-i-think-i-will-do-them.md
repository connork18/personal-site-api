Ok here are some things I THINK I am going to do, but we don't know if I AM going to do them until I actually do them:
 * have a "friday fun day" tomorrow and build MVPs of two features that people have requested: comments on listened tracks and top genre stats for users
 * tweet about my process of building them. going to be some schema decisions, front end and back end stuff. this could be productive and fruitful for lots of reasons
 * go to the Drive By Truckers concert in Broad Ripple next Wednesday night (bought the tickets)
 * where my frontseat t-shirt and pass out flyers to people in line (!!!! scary)
 * get a basic ass landing page for https://frontseat.app stood up before the concert, include the app download buttons and frontseat-feedback slack channel link

If all of this happens I will be seriously so proud of myself. 

But not at the expense of working out and spending time with family!
