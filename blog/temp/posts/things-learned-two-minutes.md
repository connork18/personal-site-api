things I have learned in 2 minutes:
 * building stuff is fun
 * building stuff is hard
 * building stuff that people want is harder
 * stamina is key
 * having fun and positive feedback helps stamina
 * schedule and regimen works better for me than something less structured
 * physical health and mental health should always beat work
