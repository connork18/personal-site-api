outbounds: 37
responses: 6 (16%)
signups: 5 (14%)
created playlists: 5 (14%)
listened to playlist: ? (I think it is 0)
w1 returning users: 0

As it relates to my w1 returning users, there are a few things missing from my analytics that could make me miss some returning users, but I think it is probably correct. 

My initial assumption was that for every 20 signups I got, I would only retain 1 of them. It would be great if I could grind and get to 100 outbounds to hopefully yield 20 signups and see if there is any possibility of getting 1 returning user. This would also afford me some extra time to see if the automatically updating playlists these users created starts to pique their interest after a couple weeks of notifications.

It is worth acknowledging briefly that a 5% week 1 retention number is not good. This could be due to a bad product or an unattractive problem or both, and I could be in both land.

Ahead of my next round of outreach, I would like to:
 * Ship the refactoring and additional analytics instrumentation I have been working on
 * Add a "Wrapped" for the stations/shows that I see people are fans of
 * Reach out to some actual BFF.fm DJs with their wrapped
