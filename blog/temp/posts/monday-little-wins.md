 * I wrote a query to see all the returning users that logged in within the last week excluding me and my family, and it was 4! The logins were about a week from me pushing some updates and alerting them about it, but that is better than none of them bothering to come back! My current goal is to get to 5 organically retained users. I don't have a great way to measure that yet.

 * I refactored lots of things today that were overdue in order to help make room for more onboarding screens. This cleaned the code base up quite a bit and I went ahead and did some other refactoring that was on my mind while I was at it.

 * I listened to a bunch of great music today, including: 
   * an entire Frontseat playlist of my friends' top songs for the last week 
   * my favorite DJ's show that happens on Mondays from 11am - 1pm ET
   * two songs that two of my friends had listened to quite a bit in the last week, each of which sparked a text conversation and had a unique story associated with it
