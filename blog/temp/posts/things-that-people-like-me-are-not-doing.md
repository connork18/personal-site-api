title: 'Things that people like me are not doing'

In the past, when I have done things that people I would describe as similar to myself aren't doing, it has served me well.

Things like:
 * Trying really hard during investment banking training rather than doing a ton of socializing
 * Moving groups to pursue my interests rather than molding into a highly-paid specialist
 * Going to join a California-based company that none of my peers have heard of rather than going into investing
 * Threw myself into the fire as non-gaming, non-"technical", non-CS dude into a technical search, discovery and virtual economy PM role

But my latest attempt is taking that to an extreme.

Since May, I have done the following along this same theme:
 * Quit job as a highly paid PM with lots of equity left
 * Coded and designed a consumer product I was passionate about, made all the startup mistakes (including favoring solution vs. problem and many others)
 * Designed, tested and launched a Guided Entrepreneurship course at my high school in exchange for part-time public teacher $$
 * Currently following a Roblox game development tutorial to make a "Piggy" game, made by a LEGENDARY 18-year old on Roblox.
 * Considering attempting $2 contract jobs to help write scripts for people's Roblox games and get some low-stakes experience working for someone else as a developer ?

I feel like I am learning. But I am eager to start working with some other smart and talented people that push me to grow and that I have fun with and can learn from.
