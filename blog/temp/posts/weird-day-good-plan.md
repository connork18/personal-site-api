Today was tough and some changes threw off the routine. Personally, we had a big family milestone! It was our daughter's first day of preschool. I also had my first meeting as part of my high school teaching/mentorship project. My student is interested in real estate, so I am suspecting we will embark on a project in that realm for the semester.

The rest of the week will get a little smoother. My plan:
 * **(Product)** Clean up the way I manage local and global state for following users. This will reduce bugs and position me well to provide a nice "Find your friends" experience during the onboarding flow. I was only able to get about 2 hours of work done on this today given other responsibilities. But I am nearly finished.

 * **(Product)** Change the plays_by_user metadata and sorting mechanism to be dynamic based on the duration selection for filters. If the duration is "Last Week" and the sort is "Most Played", it should be sorted by the tracks the user has played the most **in the last week.** Currently, it includes any songs the user has played in the last week and sorts them by the number of times the users has played tose individual tracks ever. I think this change will be valuable.

 * **(Product)** Start the process of auto-exporting filters to playlists. This feature, which I have been supporting manually, has been the biggest value driver I have seen among my existing users thus far, this will also be useful during the onboarding flow to provide value right away.

 * **(Marketing)** Send my first "sales email" to a business that expressed interest in the project. I have drafted an email, but need to refine it a little bit. This is my main marketing project for the week.

 If things go well, I might be able to accomplish the first two and the fourth tomorrow then have 3 full work days to work on auto-exporting to playlists.
