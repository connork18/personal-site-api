Purpose of this exercise was to identify what I should be focusing on to get me closer to having 5 happy users.

What are the high value actions available in the current app, order by level of engagement/likelihood of being a happy user (ascending)?
 * Download the app
 * Create an account
 * Authenticate with Spotify
 * Following someone you care about
 * Sample a song
 * Filter your feed
 * Export a feed to a playlist
 * Listen to the exported playlist
 * Create a custom feed
 * Export the custom feed to a playlist
 * Auto-export a feed to a playlist

* logging in
* people... didn't know not a clear path to accepting people and follower requests
* red for notifications
* not knowing how to filter or create a filter
* getting people they want on the platform


What are the things getting in the way of users being happy on the app?
 * They have to log in each time they open the app
 * The people they want to follow don't know they've requested to follow them 
 * They don't know that their friends are trying to follow them
 * They see things on their main feed that they don't care about
 * New users get dropped into a feed with no songs
 * They aren't able to proactively share songs with friends
 * They aren't able to react or comment on a song their friend has been listening to
 * They don't know that their playlists are updated
 * Sampling songs in the app is not efficient
 * Exporting to a playlist is hard to figure out, takes a long time, and leads to a lot of clutter

 Ideas:
 * [New users] Find people in login flow
 * [New users] Push notifications
 * [New users] Tutorial to highlight features
 * [See right songs fast] Add quick filter options
 * [See right songs fast] Add exclude tags
 * [See right songs fast] Add all genres and ability to search for them
 * [See right songs fast] Elegant entry point into the app
 * [See right songs fast] select all, unselect all    
 * [Manage feeds] Easy save as new feed flow
 * [Manage feeds] Can't see full name of feeds
 * [Playlist generator] Loading animation during playlist generation
 * [Playlist generator] Options for name, one time or recurring
 * [Playlist generator] Option to select/de-select songs during playlist creation 
 * [Playlist generator] Easily toggle auto-export feature
 * [Manage feeds] Can't see full name of feeds
 * [Discover songs fast] Play 30s sample of songs
 * [Discover songs fast] Auto-next sample feature
 * [Discover songs fast] Add-to-playlist feature
 * [Follow the right people] Push notifications for friend requests
 * [Follow the right people] Add users' top genres in the people page
 * [Follow the right people] Add basic user profile with listening stats and feed
 * [Follow the right people] Fix follower requests to be the first thing users see
 * [Follow the right people] Follow request notifcation red
 * [Follow the right people] Invite people whose taste I trust
 * [Account management] Add first/last name options in settings
 * [Account management] Add email in settings
 * [Account management] Add feedback in settings
 * [Account management] Add push notifications in settings
 * [Feedback/marketing] Create frontseat-feedback slack channel
 * [Feedback/marketing] Create basic landing page with app download buttons, slack channel
 * [Connect with friends] React to a users songs
 * [Connect with friends] Message users in the app
 * [Connect with friends] Create posts or annotate songs you've listened to

Assumptions:
 * I can get to 5 happy users with the existing feature set (without building massive new features)
 * If I add on anything else, it is stats, not chat or annotations/posts

Priorities:
 * [New users] Create the default preset in the background of sign up flow
 * [New users] Find people in login flow
 * [Manage feeds] Easy save as new feed flow
 * [Follow the right people] Fix follower requests to be the first thing users see
 * [New users] Push notifications
 * [Account management] Add push notifications in settings
 * [Follow the right people] Push notifications for friend requests
 * [See right songs fast] select all, unselect all
