<h6>Rather than compare myself to others, compare my current self to my yesterday self, and have confidence that that practice will ultimately yield huge results over a long period of time.</h6>

Life principles are particularly helpful decision making tools for me when answers are not clear.

I have decided one of mine is believing in the power of compound interest.

Interest on interest can look small for a long time but has exponential power behind it.

It is tempting for me to pursue shortcuts when building products and chasing a totally new thing. Should I scrap prior work and start fresh? Should I take more time and improve what I have?

When in doubt or if the path appears cloudy, I am going to pursue <b>improving</b> a thing that generates value <strong>for other people,</strong> as opposed to trying to take a shortcut. 

That may lead me to pivots. But I am going to have confidence that it is the fastest path.
