title: 'Feature accessibility and testing demand'

I worked really hard on some new filtering features. They are more powerful than ever, and I forced my wife and sister-in-law to try them out.

I got feedback that while cool, they aren't as accessible as I thought. Had I not been there to hold their hand, they wouldn't have understood exactly how they worked. They assured me that despite this feedback, they are definitely improvements.

I think that helps me prioritize my next project, which is to make the filters more accessible and provide users more feedback so they can understand what is driving the feed that they are looking at and don't lose track.

I also had a great conversation with another entrepreneur today. His first product was a dating app that he spent a long time on and finally launched, only to not gain traction. His M.O. now is to do everything he possibly can to test and serve demand before he writes any code.

I do NOT want to hide behind the "I'm still working on it" phase before I really put it out there in a more deliberate way and test demand. 

But at the same time, when I get some feedback like this, which gives me some confidence on how to make it better for people already on the app, it feels wasteful to go out there and acquire more users. 

As I type this, do I really believe that whoever would see a Frontseat poster or see me in a coffee shop with an advertisement or see an instagram ad would be the exact same people that I would be reaching if I did that in 3 months when I had more bells, whistles and polish? No way. 

Working on making feature set more accessible and getting real users feels like things I should start doing in parallel.
