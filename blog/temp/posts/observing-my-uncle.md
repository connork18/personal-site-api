My uncle is an avid music listener and fan in his late 50s. 

He is disenchanted with Spotify recommendations as a primary source of new music and has been for some time. He relies on lots of different methods for discovering music, including listening to radio stations.

He prefers listening to and discovering artists and albums over just songs. I have found that this is a common behavior pattern and preference among avid music fans.

He started signing up for the app and realized that he needs to get the Spotify credentials for his family account from my aunt in order to authenticate. 

If he was someone in the wild, it seems likely that I would have lost him at this point. If I don't lose him, it will be because he is my uncle and his kids are on the app. 

At least if I had a decent onboarding flow, I could have offered him some value which would make him more motivated to track down those Spotify credentials.
