As part of my radio show experiment, I am starting to reach out to people I research who could be interested in my app.

So far, I have reached out to 16 people based on some internet ninja researching that starts with looking at people that follow certain accounts on Twitter (like some BFF.fm radio shows I like) or people who are creating playlists based on the stations that are integrated into Frontseat. 

I have also considered reaching out to some DJs that are part of those stations but that is scary to me...

Then I see if they have a twitter DM available (usually they don't), I try to find them on Linkedin/instagram and ideally see if I can find their email.

When I built my first website called Keeping Current back in January 2020, I reached out to 10 strangers on instagram based on similar research and got two responses and one signup. I would be thrilled to repeat a 10% signup rate for this project. 

There are lots of things competing against me, including a low likelihood that this is a hair-on-fire problem, the low visibility of any of the direct communication channels I use, and the time it takes to craft each message/email (which I don't think should be avoided). 

My goal for the end of the year is to get 5 every week users. I basically have 4 weeks to do this. I am going to dedicate this week to this effort unless I am convinced there is something more valuable I should be doing.

What do I think my funnel %'s look like (multiply each to get my final %)?
 * 75% actually see my messages
 * 50% click on link out of intrigue
 * 20% respond to/acknowledge my message
 * 50% of the responders download the app
 * 90% create an account (~3% signup rate)
 * 80% make it past spotify authentication
 * 80% generate a playlist (~2% unit-of-value rate)
 * 5% retained as every week users (guess, based on current week 1 retention rate) (~0.1% retained user rate)

While these funnel percentages still look terrible, they are significantly better than my $35 facebook ad campaign. That campaign got me 4,000 impressions, 35 link clicks and 0 sign ups. This should be better because they are personalized messages and I am finding people using a more targeted method.

Based on these percentage assumptions, for every 100 people I reach out to, I will get 4 people to download the app and 2 people to make it through the onboarding flow and generate a playlist.

For every 500 people I reach out to, I will get 20 people to download the app, 8 people to generate a playlist and ~0.5 people as every week users. 

For every 1000 people I reach out to personally, I get 1 every week user.

If I could get to 100 reach outs, that would be a big first milestone and I will have felt like I gave it a significant effort before feeling compelled to return back to improving the app for my existing users. If I can get even 1 stranger to sign up, that will mark an improvement vs. my facebook campaign.

I will be tracking this effort so I can evaluate it afterwards. Could make for some useful content to share with others and my future self as well.
