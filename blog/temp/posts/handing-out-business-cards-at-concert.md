title: 'Handing out business cards at a concert'

Last night, I handed out 12 business cards with my app's QR code and a thank you note written on the back at a Drive By Trucker's concert.

It took guts to go up to random people, say that I am building something and would love for them to check it out. I haven't really ever done that before.

The last time I was cold calling people it was when I was on the capital markets trading floor at Barclays in New York.

It is definitely not the right forum for feedback seeking user acquisition, but could be a fun exercise someday when I am focused on getting the word out.

It was great to be out from behind my computer screen amidst music lovers. 

But when I thought about my product fitting into the lives of those music lovers, I had a few thoughts:

 * The people in here probably think that their taste in music is awesome and is better than the person next to them
 * My product appeals so much more to the Exploiter than the Explorer
 * People are more proud of their explorer selves than their exploiter selves
 * It takes a lot of work to have an enjoyable experience on my product

If I want to make my product the best it can be, I think that I am going to have to create a valuable experience for explorers and turn them into creators. 

I have some fun ideas to do that, but I also have people that are enjoying my current experience and listening to their auto-refreshing playlists. I am pumped to finish my notifications feature and get this new build to my existing users.
