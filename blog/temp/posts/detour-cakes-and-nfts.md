Today, I didn't do anything on Frontseat after spending Thursday in deep engineering land completely refactoring several pieces of the app's code, turning copy+pasted code into reusable components. 

Instead, I did my hour+ of teaching and spent the rest of the workday reading and researching to give my sister a proposal for how she can turn her crazy cool cake photos into a collection of NFTs. 

I am pretty excited that she is going to do it. I think it will be a guaranteed net positive for her, even if she doesn't end up making any money.

But if she markets them, I think she has a good chance at making at least a little bit of money. 

Either way, the crypto / NFT world has been pretty interesting to me for awhile, and I am excited to check it out with her.
