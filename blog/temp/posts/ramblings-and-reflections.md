Some thoughts:

<strong>Relationships matter, work is just a way to make money</strong>
I have a friend and former collague that is missing after apparently experiencing some issues with work and health. I am praying he is ok. One of those ground-shaking pieces of news that reminds you how important personal relationships are and that this work thing is just a game and way to put a roof over your head so you can sustain and experience those relationships.

<strong>(unsurprising) Frontseat frustrations</strong>
Frontseat is frustrating. I get impatient because I am looking for signal that this is worth continuing to work on. But that doesn't feel like the right approach. I think I should be taking the position that my product/idea is off, and my product is just my tool to experiment and help me figure out where my idea is wrong.

The risk of taking that approach is that I am barking up the wrong tree entirely. Pivoting away from my current approach seems so daunting because of the investment I have made in my infrastructure and backend systems that are geared towards this approach. 

I guess what I don't know is whether every idea has moments like these? Does any direction you start in feel like a dead end that no one cares about until you just keep pushing through?

My guess-- there is some evaluation you can do at the beginning to gain some confidence in the economic margins. Going into the music/content/people discovery space, I knew the economic margins were thin. Thin economic margins means thin attention margins means lower reception in the marketplace and less people responding to your messages, less people logging in, etc. 

<strong>Path forward</strong>
I'm not sure what my path forward from here is. I know that seeing the final results of my experiment will take some time. I also am realizing that in order to have any possibility of success in this market, I need to do more to attract the "hard" side of the market--the explorers / creators / content curators. The question is--is that experiment worth the effort? Will I learn something that gets me closer to my goal of building a valuable technology product?

<strong>Auto-pilot</strong>
My last thought--part of me wants to put this project into autopilot and change my infrastructure such that I am remaining under the free tier of AWS for everything. I think each project can take awhile to get traction regardless of what the initial economic/attention margins look like. I have happy users that would be bummed if I shut it down, and so ultimately, I could see myself stripping away anything that is not serving my happiest users and changing the product such that I can provide the service on the free tier of AWS.

Honestly, that effort could end up sharpening the knife and making my product more attractive anyway, even if it doesn't feel like the original "vision" I had. It could end up being pretty liberating and allow me to feel comfortable exploring other problem spaces without killing the project.
