title: 'Ship it'

Today I ran into a scenario where the main function I wanted to release (configure filters to auto-export to playlists) was completed and shippable. I was tempted to optimize it and explore some ways of making it more accessible, but I stopped myself and focused on shipping what I had.

I am very glad I did. I can always optimize, but going from 0 to 1 is a big deal. 

I gave myself this advice in a prior post after going down a rabbit hole and bundling features, only to realize that I need to decouple them because the "add on" was going to be big undertaking. I ended up scrapping a bunch of that code and wasting some time. 

I learned from my mistakes!
