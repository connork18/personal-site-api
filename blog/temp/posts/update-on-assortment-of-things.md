 * have been hacking around with Frontseat, starting to figure out a design that I am optimistic can test my radio station fan hypothesis while still improving the experience for the friends I have that are actually using the app (and starting to recommend it to others). I have been getting feedback on sketches and screenshots/videos of hacked-up versions of the app from existing users, sort of conducting lots of mini-experiments.

 * have been getting more interested in blockchain stuff. wrote my first a smart contract and minted an NFT with it. going through the bitcoin and ethereum white papers, but am not satisfied with the level of detail that I understand cryptography algorithms. I am trying not to let it prevent me from tinkering around but I kind of want to take a step back and do some reading/coursework/exercises on cryptography

 * got funding for my Guided Entrepreneurship class at my old high school approved. The announcement went out to students, but I am probably going to have to do a fair amount of marketing for this semester to maximize the chance that I get to work with the caliber of students I am hoping to serve.

 * haven't heard back from the startup competition.
 
 * we started decorating for the holidays already and so I'm starting to get in the spirit!
