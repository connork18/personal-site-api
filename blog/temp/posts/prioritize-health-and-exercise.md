I really need to prioritize my health and exercise. It helps my energy and happiness levels, which helps me get more creative work done in a day.

I am not in a client services or management business. This is the most creative work I have ever done. I am solving a big puzzle, and I need these hours to be high quality. 

Sometimes I will get tempted to open my computer to see if I can squeeze a new release in or something (especially in the morning). This usually means my workout is reduced or skipped.

I am 3 for 3 this week in getting the things that are usually in my morning routine completed, although it has bled into the day a little bit. 

Just a reminder to myself that getting sleep and exercising should not be thought of as a competing priority to my work, but rather a supercharger.
