I still have some minor bugs to fix on push notifications for friend requests, but otherwise have shipped all of the things that I said I wanted to ship a couple of days ago.

I am starting to get to another lull coming on, which in the past has been fixed with <b>onboarding more users.</b>

There are lots of rich features that I feel compelled to build, but I also feel like I need to be excellent at the unique thing I offer before running adding stuff.

My quick hypotheses on things I should do:
 * TALK TO MY USERS AND NEW USERS
 * let existing users change/update account information (username, display name, email, etc)
 * create a simple landing page
 * in app and on website, advertise #frontseat-feedback slack channel and contact us
 * support the quick filters functions for the top buttons
 * add 30s sample
 * make separate find radio station page (and add a couple more radio stations)
 * add top genres
 * add exclude clauses
 * make everything touchable (go to spotify, or filter)
 * add channels for feedback

My hypotheses on things I shouldn't do (yet):
 * make profiles
 * do auto-scroll / play
 * applause/react button
 * album art
 * new home screen
 * calc "last listened to"
 * support other stats

 I will give it more thought and hopefully have more confidence after talking to more users.
