What is the future of education?

I have some theories about what has been happening over the last couple of decades and where things might be going. These are not unique thoughts.

<b>Things are moving earlier.</b> College sports recruiting and corporate recruiting of talented college kids has been moving earlier and earlier. When I was recruiting for investment banking internships through when I was working at a bank, I could see the recruiting events and deadlines moving earlier and earlier. People/organizations that have a need for talented people are trying beat their competition and lock down candidates early.

<b>People are having more diverse careers</b>

<b>There are way fewer barriers to younger people doing incredible things</b>

<b>The returns on a traditional college education seem to be diminishing</b>

I will probably start exploring this a little bit more as a journaling topic.
