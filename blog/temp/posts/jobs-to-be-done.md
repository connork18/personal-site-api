I saw a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6839046258649387008?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6839046258649387008%2C6839087153885040640%29">reply</a> by a guy named Ross Moran to Andrew Chen's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewchen_heres-why-its-so-dangerous-to-scale-a-product-activity-6839046258649387008-H7Pu">LinkedIn post</a> on the dangers of scaling a product too fast. The reply alluded to Clayton Christensen's theory: "Jobs to be done", which I had never heard of before.

The reply said: 

<i>"I cannot stress enough that products and services are purchased to do a job.

As Clayton Christensen documented as 'jobs to be done'. It doesn't matter how many bells and whistles a product has if it doesn't meet the basics of getting the job done.

Every job has a physical element and an emotional or mental element.

As an example I will illustrate: a person carrying bricks up a ladder 4 stories to a roof will be physically challenged to carry the bricks and also mentally because they need to concentrate so they don't fall off.

They will seek a solution to getting the bricks to the roof, the job to be done. A crane or some kind of lifting machine. Physical stress over because crane can lift a lot more at once and emotionally feeling a lot safer.

Once the bricks get to the roof the person has fulfilled the minimum requirements of the job. If the crane has bells and whistles of a radio, a microwave, a TV and a washing machine these could be nice to have but do not contribute to the basics of getting the job of getting the bricks to the roof."</i>

My sister-in-law just completed a poster for the app as a portfolio project that says, "Need new music? Find it on Frontseat." Unless people can come to the app and effortlessly extract new music--the job to be done--why would I expect them to show up again? 

I am going to keep focusing on helping users quickly get great new music from sources they trust.
