19 days to turn my product into something that I can test it's functionality with fans of radio stations and not f up my existing users.

What are the things I would like to include before that? What is my wish list?

 * Home screen that provides an entry point for exploring feed, checking out user profiles and creating/managing playlists

 * A simplified signup/auth process with a "Sign up with Spotify" button

 * A "create your first playlist" flow during onboarding that helps satisfy my radio station fans without offending my friend-to-friend users

 * a profile page and the ability to browse other stations and user profiles

 * Replacing custom feeds with playlists

 * Improving the playlist creation flow, allowing you to make decisions incrementally, see the results of those decisions and iterate/change them before spitting out a playlist

I don't <strong>need</strong> to do all of these things. What do I absolutely HAVE to do?

 * Figure out my new home screen. I think it is important to have the playlists present on the first screen because I think they are my primary value proposition. I am also planning to spit users out into Spotify after the onboarding process, and so when they come back to the app it would be good for them to see the playlist they just created to tie the experience together. 

 * Improve the playlist creation flow to "choose your own adventure", looking for friends or stations/shows. I also need to figure out how to show the songs prior to generating the playlist.

 * Ensure that playlist flow is implemented well into the onboarding flow.

This could change, but I think it is right.
