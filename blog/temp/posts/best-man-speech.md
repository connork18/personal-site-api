title: 'Best man speech'

I gave a best man speech for my long time best friend, Chris Miller. It was delivered without cards or notes, had some improvisation, and it went well! 

The guidelines I tried to follow were: 
 * don't read from papers or cards -- do the work to know what you want to say (it is bad ass to get up there and just grab the mic)
 * select a big idea that ties everything together
 * don't rely too heavily on humor, but include a couple funny anecdotes that fit the broader theme and provide new information about the groom and/or bride
 * focus on the couple, not on my relationship with the groom
 * don't describe, tell a story (e.g. don't say "she is funny, kind, sweet, etc")
 * don't shy from being meaningful and emotional, but get the speech out and don't blubber
 * enjoy the speech and all the moments leading up to it as opposed to stressing out (I had 4-5 drinks during cocktail hour leading up to it)

Here is the gist:

-----------------------

My name is Connor Kelley, I am the best man and I have been Chris's best friend for basically our entire lives. We grew up down the street from each other in Batesville and shared an apartment in New York City after graduating college.

Before I get started, I would like to thank the Miller family for last night's rehearsal dinner and the incredible champagne. Thank you for being generous with Chris's time over the years. We would not be as close today if you didn't trust that us hanging out was time well spent. 

Thank you in particular to Denise Miller, Chris's mom. One time when Chris and I were in grade school, we were talking about the future. I said that it is going to be awesome and we are going to be best friends forever and our families will live near each other. Chris said, "No we won't. We definitely won't live near each other and we probably won't even be friends." He was being brutally realistic and practical, but that really upset me. There may have been tears involved. Later that night, Denise heard about this and made Chris call me to apologize. I really appreciated that, and Chris, that really was a stupid thing to say.

I also want to thank the Ackell family for being such great hosts in Appleton and for today's celebration. Thank you for integrating Chris so seamlessly into your lives and thank you Dr. Ackell for getting Chris started with some new hobbies like golf and pheasant hunting. One thing I have learned about Chris is that when he thinks he has something figured out, he really trusts his instincts and goes for it. Unfortunately, when he shot a pheasant running on the ground near the Ackell's dogs, his instincts were dead wrong. So thank you for your patience, I know Chris looking forward to pheasant hunting a lot more with you in the future, Dr. Ackell.

So now into the toast..

Chris and I have been virtually inseparable for the vast majority of our lives. That inseparability has created some skepticism and defensiveness towards each other's girlfriends. I think that this is because they posed a threat to our ability to spend so much time together and we were scared of being displaced as the "best friend".

But Chris is also very much a romantic. He has continually put himself out there in the hopes of finding love. While this probably helped him find Maggie, it has also led to some heartbreaks over the years. Myself and the other groomsmen have had to pick up the pieces. 

After I proposed to my wife in April 2016 and started planning the wedding for next June, Chris demanded that I reserve him a plus one. I said, "Who is your plus one?" And he said, "Well, I don't have one yet." And I said, "Well that is ridiculous, we aren't going to plan and budget around you having a girlfriend by then." I think there was some truth to the position I took, but there was definitely part of me that didn't like the idea of my friend entertaining a date that I hardly knew as opposed to spending time with me.

Then Chris met Maggie on August 21, 2016 and I met her a couple weeks later. I would love to say that on the first meeting I knew there was something special, but it was very brief and, like Dr. Ackell's disposition towards Maggie's boyfriends over the years, I was quiet and a little skeptical.

Things evolved and it became a no brainer that Maggie was coming to our wedding. And she not only came, but got to work and joined the sweatshop operation in the basement of my wife's family's house to solve our DIY flowers crisis.

It was not too long before any feelings of skepticism I had vanished and were replaced with love and gratitude. 

Maggie, I already know you very well, but every time I get to hang out with you again, I am more impressed with you as a human being and more grateful that my best friend has found such an incredible life partner. 

Luckily my wife feels the same way that I do about Maggie, which means I'll get to spend that much more time with them and my master plan that I pitched to Chris has a chance at coming true.

Please raise your glasses and join me in toasting to Chris and Maggie Miller.
