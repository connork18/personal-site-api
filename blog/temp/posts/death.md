<i>"Let each thing you do, say, or intend be like that of a dying person." - Marcus Aurelius</i>

Periodically, I do a guided meditation focused on death. 

It is inspired by the stoic view of death as something that should be thought of frequently, not out of fear, but as a guide to help rid your mind of the junk that doesn't matter and live rightly.

I am not sure whether that quote is from Meditations or not but it is attributed to Marcus Aurelius on the internet. But I think it sums this concept up pretty well:

This may be coming to my mind because I made some mistakes this week or maybe the 20th anniversary of 9/11 is in the back of my mind.

Either way, I agree with that line of thinking and happen to be using it as a tool this evening.
