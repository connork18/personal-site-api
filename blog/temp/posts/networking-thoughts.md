Networking.

This is the topic that my students are most eager to hear from me about.

How do I network?
What is successful networking?

I am not an expert in this--or at least I don't think of myself as an expert. I still mess this up all the time. Right now I am still feeling bummed about someone that I was beginning to think of as a mentor that hasn't responded to my last 3 emails. This might be due to a bold decision I made in responding to one of his questions (a possible misfire?) or maybe he's just busy?

But even though I still make plenty mistakes in this realm (and Entrepreneurship, which is the premise of the course), I have definitely learned a few things and built some skills relative to a high school student or even my peers.

I think there are a few components of successful networking.

 * Find your starting point.
 * Finding the right people.
 * Getting in touch with them.
 * Getting them to respond and agree to speak with you.
 * Getting them actually on the phone/in person.
 * Having a productive conversation.
 * Concluding with a next step.
 * Following up with an immediate thank you.
 * Connect and demonstrate progress (~2-3 mos).
 * Retain as lifelong friend/mentor.

And if I wanted to follow the rule of three, I could simplify that into 3 pillars:

 1. Get the right people on the phone.
 2. Have a productive conversation.
 3. Retain as lifelong friend/mentor.

Before reaching out to people, it is helpful to look inward and ask yourself--what do I think want?

It is a similar process to entrepreneurship. Starting with a hunch gives you a direction, a hypothesis to test and reason to investigate.

In networking, your purpose helps provide you a shortcut to the people your brain wants to talk to the most. It creates a reason to pay attention to what they have to say. You have something you need to figure out and these people can help you. It also gives these people a reason to respond to you. The matter has some urgency and your purpose inspires them. It is daunting as a mentor to help someone figure out their life. But helping you complete a branding presentation or scale your clothing business or analyzing an investment or solving a healthcare problem is tangible.

In reality, everyone has their own set of "secrets" that you can learn from them. I wish that I had a little sense of urgency with everyone that I met at parties and in other casual settings. Before every conversation I had, I wish every there was a little voice that whispered in my ear: "What can I learn about life and the way the world works from this person?" Unfortunately, that is not how I conduct myself in my day to day practice.

This is why trying to figure out what you want helps. If you are pursuing a project or have a direction, it creates a sense of urgency that helps you and your targets.

The next thing I need to break down is "finding the right people."

Recently when I needed to find people, I have used LinkedIn, Twitter, Google searching and research. It really depends on where your targeted people are.

For the Roblox marketing agency business I am working on, I read and look through news articles to see whether there is anyone from the brand or the 
development studio side that is mentioned or quoted. Then, I look those people up on LinkedIn (where they are pretty much always findable). Sometimes these people have personal websites where there is an email address. Sometimes they are direct messageable without buying LinkedIn Premium ($33/month...) and sometimes you need to reach out and connect with them after which LinkedIn lets you send them a note.

Recently, I reached out to someone I really want to talk to for one of my projects. I DM'd him on Twitter, but didn't get a response. In fact, I saw him post on Twitter after I sent my DM, which makes me think he might have seen my message and thought "I'll deal with this later" (which many times can mean "never"). 

This type of stuff can be demoralizing, but you can't let it be. PEOPLE WANT TO HELP AND CONNECT WITH INTERESTING PEOPLE THAT THEY THINK COULD HELP THEM. This is something everyone should probably write down and put in their helpful life notebook. People may not always respond the first, second, or third times. Sometimes the channel you are using to reach out to them may not be the method with which they prefer to have that kind of communication. Sometimes they are super busy and may think "if this person really cares, they'll follow up with me" (without even thinking about it).

I sent my twitter DM at 9:30am. He tweeted at 10:30am. I connected with him on LinkedIn at 3:30pm and sent him a personal note with it. He responded within 30 minutes! This doesn't happen every time, but is a great example proving why you should not give up or get discouraged after your first "no". 

Just because you didn't catch any fish in the spot you've been fishing, doesn't mean you can't catch any fish in the lake. Try a different technique, move down the bank 20 yards, blah blah.

So bringing this back to my students--what should the next homework assignment be for them?

I think I might have skipped right over profiling the type of people you want to talk to you. Taking your starting point and mission and translating it to helpful people is kind of an important step too. This can involve an analysis or understanding of the type of people that can help you. Mentors that have done it before? People you can partner with? Possible customers? Connectors that are accessible but don't have the exact expertise?

This profiling is obviously made much easier based on your initial hunch or motivation.

But it is one of those things that is done in tandem with actually identifying the right people. Some people may not be the PERFECT person for you to talk to, but they are super accessible! You can get a call with them with high confidence in the matter of a few days. And they more than likely know multiple people that they can get you hooked up with that are closer to your perfect person. Getting a referral is better than reaching out cold. Pursue referrals.

It is important to come up with a solid list of people because some people may take longer to get on the phone than others. It is also time intensive and you only have so many free blocks in your schedule. The people you reach out to first should have a high accessibility x likely helpfulness score. 

But, once you have made an effort and have some people that seem good, you should start your outreach process. Each conversation you have is going to make you smarter and better and generate leads for building your network. The accessible people may also be lower stakes and so it can be helpful to just get on the phone with them as soon as you can. You may get some referrals to higher stakes/higher helpfulness people and you will become an improved interviewer.

People are varying degrees of busy. For one mentor I speak with occasionally, I book an appointment with his assistant months in advance. Others may offer to speak with you tomorrow night. It is important to stay flexible and do whatever you have to do to accomodate both cases. But once you have some people that feel like they are important to talk to, start reaching out right away. While waiting for them, you can continue to build and refine your list/directory. 

Alright that's all I got right now. This is some good material to edit, distill and organize and then introduce to my students next week.
