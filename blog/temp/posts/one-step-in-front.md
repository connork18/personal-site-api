Someone I met today said that they have heard part of the startup game is just continuing to put one foot in front of the other.

Today's one foot forward consisted of a total brain pretzel, lots of coding-deleting-sketching-repeat, and FINALLY ending in an elegant tech and UX design. I was able to implement it just enough to prove that it worked well.

Compound interest is a magical thing, but in this game, every interest payment is fought for. There is nothing passive about it!
