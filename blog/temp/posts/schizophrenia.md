I started this post attempting to explain how I am feeling. I ended up googling the dictionary definition of Schizophrenia.

<i>"Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling."</i>

Excluding some words to make it not nearly as serious, that sounds a bit like how I feel now as it relates to my attempt to create something new but having no fucking clue what I am doing.

The hilarious part is that all it takes is me seeing someone using the app on Monday morning when I check out the data and then I am on top of the world. The hilarious-er part is that this thing that I am focusing so intently on is just a cross between a game and a painting, and people could easily do without it. 

I am going to give myself a little credit here--I <i>think</i> that last sentence could be said about the early versions of lots of tools or experiences that people come to rely on. 

I am going to do a cold turkey break tomorrow from any work or code related stuff and start a new fiction book.
