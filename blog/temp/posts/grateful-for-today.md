This morning, I got 2-3 hours of coding in before my daughter woke up. I finished the filter-by-radio-show feature. This allowed me to generate a dynamically updating playlist based on the songs played by my favorite BFF.fm show, Top Spin, run by a woman named Natalie. She is my absolute favorite DJ right now. 

The result was a ton of new music, all of which I happened to love, playing around the house all day while I hung out with my daughter. Our nanny was sick and is now on vacation, so I have been the caretaker during biz hours several times this week. My daughter and I worked in the yard, played some computer games that work on memorization, read books, messed around in the house, exercised, and went on a long walk.

Then, Claire came home and we went to meet the teacher and classmates at the preschool our daughter will be attending soon. It was hilarious and awesome.

THEN, our babysitter came (my sister-in-law), and Claire and I went on a date for the first time in awhile. We went to Marott Park and sat on a blanket by the river listening to a playlist of new songs that I have been collecting over the last 3 weeks (songs credited in large part to BFF.fm's Top Spin, my friend Connor (Clegg), Maddie from The Current and my friend Sameer). We went to dinner afterwards and had a great night.

Dr. Seuss said something like "life is a great balancing act." Striking it just right is not easy and is a never ending, daily pursuit and fluctuations. Today was one of those lucky days where it sort of just worked, and I am grateful!
