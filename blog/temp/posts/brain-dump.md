I am excited to enter the next version of my product, but it is not going to happen overnight. I think I need to have patience and just keep chipping away at whatever I think gets me closer to 5 happy users, even if it is not feasible by the end of the year. 

I have been getting interested in the concept of "blockchain backends". My vision for Frontseat is a data/information marketplace where people can sell/share information frictionlessly with one another and consume it in an "I get the information I trust at the time I need it in as little time as possible" interface. The "you own your own data, share it securely with whoever you want" vibes of my vision have some crossover with the principles of web3.

My hypothesis is that, while engineering time I would spend in the crypto world would be valuable, the most valuable thing I can do is follow my interests. Right now, I am interested in building Frontseat for people I've targeted, and I think trying to mix in my blockchain interests at this stage would not be in the best interests of trying to get product/market fit on this. 

If evidence that suggests the people I am building this for <i>really</i> don't want it starts to be overwhelming, then I may feel free to start exploring the crypto world. Who knows.

In the meantime, I am focused on:
 * Building a notifications tab/feed
 * Adding notifications for auto-updated playlists
 * Improving the UI/UX of comments
 * Indicating songs that have comments in the feed
 * potentially adding an applause button, and eventually re-working the ListenedTrack UI
 * fixing the endless scroll feature
 * adding ability to update account settings
 * fixing the genre filters to be more genres => narrower filters instead of other way around
 * adding notifications screen during onboarding so users can get context before being prompted to opt in to notifications
 * offering more flexibility on the playlist generation flow
 * adding exclude filters
 * allowing you to undo changes to filters
 * offering "quick filters" options when clicking on specific buttons
 * add a home screen that offers an entry point to jump into your feeds
 * add top genres
 * whatever I find out is more important to do than the above
 * and other things I can't think of right now
