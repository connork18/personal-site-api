Today, I set out to build MVPs of two features: comments on listened tracks and top genres for users. **Shiny new features** that can add real user value but require extra investment to make happen.

I only got to the comments feature, but I delivered something that works and has potential.

I opted to make as much progress on one of them rather than hack up my code base with a new feature that risks being extra half baked and rushed.

I think the comments feature was a good one to focus on, and I believe the work that must be done for its value to be fully realized will also enhance the value of my other features.

If discovering music is like eating healthy, notifications are a key part of that and can serve as an entry point to things like auto-updated playlists, follow requests/accepts, threads on listenedtracks and more. Building a notifications tab and having a notifications model/api AND building the conditional UI components to render the different types of notifications in the notifications feed is real work that has a chance to yield real value.

Documenting it on twitter was a little scary and a first for me too. So I am pretty happy with how it went. 

Looking forward to mowing the lawn and doing some landscaping tomorrow.
