I just finished creating my personal website following the generous Next.js tutorial, and this is the first post. 

I still have **lots** of work to do to customize it and make it fully mine. But I am getting started! 

I met my goal and was able to follow this tutorial and get it live in 3.5 hours, with minutes to spare before my 5pm deadline.

I also recorded my process, which I might touch up and throw into a post tomorrow. Fun!
