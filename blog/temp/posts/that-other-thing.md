title: 'Oh I will just improve that other thing too'

I had just an hour or two to work today. I wanted to publish the filter-by-radio-show feature to the app stores so one of my target Android users could access it, but wanted to do just a little bit more testing to make sure it worked as expected. 

As usual, I tested the feature as part of the flow of a new user. I discovered some suboptimal behavior so I dove in and started refactoring. The refactor led to some design decisions about sharing data across the application and proved to be more than I could finish in my alotted time. 

Luckily, I caught myself after awhile and went ahead and started publishing the version I had built prior to embarking on this refactor journey. I published the new Android version (currently In Review) and was able to get the latest iOS version on Testflight, not yet submitted to the App Store review gods.

This is a pretty frequent software development thing. And so I just wanted to remind myself to be deliberate in what I am trying to achieve during my work time. Before I embark on one of those "oh I will just improve that other thing too and then publish it", ask myself if anyone could be happier with the feature published as is and whether I can deliver this other thing as a follow up.
