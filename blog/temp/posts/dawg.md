"Stop f'ing around and get your workouts in.

Don't forget that nothing else matters except for your health.

Everything else flows when you are getting after it -- relationships, the house, and even that work &business stuff you happen to care so much about.

Stop getting caught up and get swole."

^^^^^ For the listeners out there, this is actually how I talk to myself. I'm still a meathead at heart.
