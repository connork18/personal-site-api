I did a customer interview today. Sampling is a real difficulty when doing customer interviews. People are so different! Generalizing things that are important to everyone based on a conversation with one person is dangerous. But it is necessary at some level. That is a big piece of the puzzle that I am trying to solve.

I think I feel confident in stating that lots of people are very interested in and are motivated to share things that are important to them. 

Going into this project I had a framework for thinking about everyone on a spectrum of explorer <--> exploiter. My platform caters primarily to exploiters. This presents some difficulties.

The explorers are critical to get on the platform so that the exploiters can have the content that they want. Hoping that exploiters convince explorers to get on the platform so they can have a good experience does not sound like a solid long term strategy.

Also, while I do think there is a spectrum, I think that at both ends of the spectrum there is a non-zero percentage of explorer/exploiter. Said differently, everyone has that piece of them that wants to sort of feel like mr./mrs. cool and add value to others based on their artistic taste.

I have some friends on Frontseat that I get great music from--how cool would it be to create the platform that transforms everyone into a curator/creator? These people listen to music as if they are a DJ. They don't listen to filler stuff or "best new indie" spotify playlists. They follow trusted media outlets, radio stations, artists and labels and end up being a passive curator for me. When I reach out to them and say "oh I love this song you've been listening to" they are very quick to point out some interesting context behind the song/artist in the same way that a DJ does.

Is there any way for me help them be the creators that others (myself) want them to be? Can I do that in a Frontseat vision-aligned way that is differentiated and unique?

I feel like this gets me into bopdrop/twitter post songs territory, which I don't really like. 

One of the issues and motivations for me to create Frontseat is that I did not see the people that I actually wanted music from "posting" music. I myself also have very little interest in posting music. I have generally stopped posting on my primary social media outlets and frankly have no interest in building a social media company.

I want to build something that efficiently delivers music I want from sources I am like and trust in a digestible and readily consummable format when I want it. 

I know that the people I want music from are eager and excited to share that music with me. What can I provide that adds value to them helps them be the creators that I think they (and I) want them to be? 

Does it require a different product? Or are there avenues within my existing product that can permit that?
