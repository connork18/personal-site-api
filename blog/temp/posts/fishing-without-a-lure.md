title: 'Fishing without a lure'

Today was more successful fishing than yesterday, but after trolling for walleye for 1 to 1.5 hours, we realized that we no longer had a lure on the end of our line. So embarrassing and hilarious and sad--I hope for pride's sake it was not that way the whole time after feeling it briefly hit the bottom early on.

I think there is another product building analogy there too (and that in general, fishing is a great metaphor for this 0 to 1, product/market fit discovery process). 

I may have what appears on the surface to be a good product in a market where there are some passionate niche customers out there. But maybe some of the product shortcomings that I know are present are preventing the product from becoming a competitive solution to a fast-paced consumer entertainment problem that offers little patience.
