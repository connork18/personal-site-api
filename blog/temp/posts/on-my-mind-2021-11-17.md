What's on my mind?

There are apps out there that are better than mine.

I didn't get the level of exercise in this morning that I would have liked.

I still have a bunch of yard work to do today.

This cryptography course is going to take a lot of time.

My high school course may not attract the caliber of students I am looking for.

WHOA! negative stuff.

How about positives?

My wife is amazing.

My daughter is happy and healthy and an absolute joy.

My app and associated skills are moving in positive directions.

My course has absolutely changed the life of my student this past semester.

I am surrounded by family and I am making new friends.

I have had a couple of those magic moments recently when a song I haven't heard in a long time gets turned on and it hits the spot.

I am healthy and in pretty good shape.

I have come such a long way in writing code, designing products, and listening to customers.

Cool.
