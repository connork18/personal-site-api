My current professional existence consists of:
 * (lots of time) pursuing a long and arduous path to create a successful consumer product with 1 year of coding experience is fun.
 * (small/medium amount of time) teaching an innovative independent study course that will yield some current income 
 * investing our assets

It is super fun to be in control. The draw to get a job comes in waves, but is never too intense.

Getting a paycheck, working alongside other people, making an impact on an organization and the customers with positive feedback from colleagues and managers is fun and motivating.

I believe that achieving the type of financial success I am looking for in building scalable stuff takes a long time--especially given my unique background (or lack thereof). 

Luckily, I am <b>loving</b> the journey. I view that fact as an extremely positive signal. I could do this forever--just continually iterating and and iterating and making something better and better. Eventually based on this compounding effort/expertise, it is going to get good. 

The question: "Is this the right thing to be working on" creeps into my mind periodically. What is the opportunity cost of not diving into other spaces? I know what the opportunity cost of not getting a job at a big tech company and it is huge.

Financially, there is no reason for me to be in a hurry. I am building everything myself so the "expensive" consumer product is not expensive in terms of cash out the door, just lost cash that could be coming in from getting a job.

Learning about what people want and what works when building things for people is rare knowledge, as is the experience that comes with getting something off the ground yourself.

I also think that going deep into the solution discovery process will be valuable elsewhere. Any problem space I enter is going to have an arduous journey of some kind. Bouncing around from problem to problem because I don't have immediate success feels dumb. And if I have mucked my way through to actually figuring out and providing what people want, I believe that effort and process will be fruitful in other problem spaces.

I always wanted a direct line to the customer rather than working for a manager. Customers are like the harshest managers--they kind of don't care if you exist and can adjust your paycheck on a whim! But making them happy can create a lot more value than making managers happy.

I am pretty confident that I am doing the right thing. Side note--if something crazy happened and I needed to get a job tomorrow, I would be able to AND I would be able to string along my app because of the skills I have acquired in the last 5 months.
