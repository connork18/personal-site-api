web3 is where I would like to make my home as an entrepreneur. The customers and possible collaborators I have met have energized me, their problems resonate with me, and I feel positioned to solve them. Social DAOs, NFT projects and many many others clearly have needs as they wrangle this new world and strive towards audacious goals. Despite being overwhelmingly busy, they are willing to try out and learn about the new tools that might help them be more successful.

The type of web3 company I want to build is one that leverages the power of incentives and community to improve people's lives across the value chain. I think web3 has the unique opportunity to take Roblox's values--think in systems, take the long view, relentlessly iterate, and community > company > self--to the next level.

The potential customers I have met running DAOs and NFT projects are people I would be excited to serve for the next decade.
